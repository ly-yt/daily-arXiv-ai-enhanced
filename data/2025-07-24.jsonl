Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency. To address this issue,\nwe propose Conflict-Based Flex Distribution that distributes flex in proportion\nto the number of collisions.

However, they face critical challenges in\nspecialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of\nannotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which\nhinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert,\nan ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning\ncapabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the\nintelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and\nleverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease\nclassification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis\nwithin a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically\naligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable\nreasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen,\nachieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks,\nsurpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in\nzero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%,\nsignificantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling\nlaw between data quality and model capability ($L \\propto N^{0.068}$),\ndemonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance\ndata utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with\ndiagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned\nMLLM and explores a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specific\nMLLMs. Our project can be found at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert."}

A simulation protocol serves as a\n\"scaffold\" to streamline multiple perspective-taking simulations, supporting\nusers in reflecting on, transitioning between, and integrating across\nperspectives. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate HoPeS in the\ncontext of institutional dynamics and land use change, enabling both\nnarrative-driven and numerical experiments. In an illustrative experiment, a\nuser successively adopts the perspectives of a system observer and a researcher\n- a role that analyses data from the embedded land use model to inform\nevidence-based decision-making for other LLM agents representing various\ninstitutions.

In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with\nreal-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic\nagents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty\nsteering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers\nsupervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and\nimplement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network optimizers,\nand (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We\nfurther propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI networks and evaluate it on\na 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show\nthat symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone\nLLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy\nwith a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of\n82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world\ntestbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and\nresource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%.\nDrawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the\nsymbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven\nnetworks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even\nas LLMs advance."}
