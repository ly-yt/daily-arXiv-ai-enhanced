This paper introduces Team Coordination on Graphs\nwith Risky Edges (TCGRE), where agents collaborate to reduce traversal costs on\nhigh-risk edges via support from teammates. We reformulate TCGRE as a 3D\nmatching problem-mapping robot pairs, support pairs, and time steps-and\nrigorously prove its NP-hardness via reduction from Minimum 3D Matching. To\naddress this complexity, (in the conference version) we proposed efficient\ndecomposition methods, reducing the problem to tractable subproblems:\nJoint-State Graph (JSG): Encodes coordination as a single-agent shortest-path\nproblem. Coordination-Exhaustive Search (CES): Optimizes support assignments\nvia exhaustive pairing. Receding-Horizon Optimistic Cooperative A* (RHOCA*):\nBalances optimality and scalability via horizon-limited planning. Further in\nthis extension, we introduce a dynamic graph construction method\n(Dynamic-HJSG), leveraging agent homogeneity to prune redundant states and\nreduce computational overhead by constructing the joint-state graph\ndynamically. Theoretical analysis shows Dynamic-HJSG preserves optimality while\nlowering complexity from exponential to polynomial in key cases. Empirical\nresults validate scalability for large teams and graphs, with HJSG\noutperforming baselines greatly in runtime in different sizes and types of\ngraphs. This work bridges combinatorial optimization and multi-agent planning,\noffering a principled framework for collaborative pathfinding with provable\nguarantees, and the key idea of the solution can be widely extended to many\nother collaborative optimization problems, such as MAPF."}

The rapid growth of\nautonomous vehicles (AVs) has prompted new traffic designs that aim to optimize\ninteractions among AVs. However, effective interactions between AVs remains\nchallenging due to the absence of centralized control. Besides, there is a need\nfor balancing multiple factors, including passenger demands and overall traffic\nefficiency. Traditional rule-based, optimization-based, and game-theoretic\napproaches each have limitations in addressing these challenges. Rule-based\nmethods struggle with adaptability and generalization in complex scenarios,\nwhile optimization-based methods often require high computational resources.\nGame-theoretic approaches, such as Stackelberg and Nash games, suffer from\nlimited adaptability and potential inefficiencies in cooperative settings. This\npaper proposes an Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)-based framework for AV\ninteractions that overcomes these limitations by utilizing a decentralized and\nadaptive strategy evolution mechanism. A causal evaluation module (CEGT) is\nintroduced to optimize the evolutionary rate, balancing mutation and evolution\nby learning from historical interactions.
