However, when deployed in novel settings, LLMs often encounter\nsituations where they must integrate parametric knowledge with new or\nunfamiliar information. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can combine\nknowledge in-context with their parametric knowledge through the lens of\ncounterfactual reasoning. Through synthetic and real experiments in multi-hop\nreasoning problems, we show that LLMs generally struggle with counterfactual\nreasoning, often resorting to exclusively using their parametric knowledge.\nMoreover, we show that simple post-hoc finetuning can struggle to instill\ncounterfactual reasoning ability -- often leading to degradation in stored\nparametric knowledge. Ultimately, our work reveals important limitations of\ncurrent LLM's abilities to re-purpose parametric knowledge in novel settings."}

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety\nbenchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,\noffering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world\napplications."}

Prior\nresearch has revealed that LLMs often fail to grasp the notion of safe\nbehaviors, resulting in either unjustified refusals to harmless prompts or the\ngeneration of harmful content. While substantial efforts have been made to\nimprove their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we\ntake a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts\nin instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a\nfixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt\nto each specific user input on the safety of the responses.

While keeping the LLM\nparameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of\nharmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through\nextensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the\nrobustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful\nprompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\\%$.\nResults also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs\nupto $100\\%$ more robust against different attack strategies.

This paper introduces Bayesian Epistemology with Weighted\nAuthority (BEWA), a formally structured architecture that operationalises\nbelief as a dynamic, probabilistically coherent function over structured\nscientific claims. Each claim is contextualised, author-attributed, and\nevaluated through a system of replication scores, citation weighting, and\ntemporal decay. Belief updates are performed via evidence-conditioned Bayesian\ninference, contradiction processing, and epistemic decay mechanisms. The\narchitecture supports graph-based claim propagation, authorial credibility\nmodelling, cryptographic anchoring, and zero-knowledge audit verification.

Specifically, we introduce the RFMDataset (Reveal\nFailure Modes), a collection of 200 diverse mathematical proof problems, and\nthoroughly evaluate advanced models' performance on it.

The emergence\nof \"thinking\" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither\nproduce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is\nmore likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent\nunderstanding of when model-free RL will lead to \"thinking\" as a strategy for\nreward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a\ntheoretical model which we call a \\textit{thought Markov decision process}\n(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an\nabstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP\nmodel, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether\nor not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent\nto the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing\nto act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our\ntheory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like\nbehavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable\nthinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy\ndomain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought\nactions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents."}

However, due to the network dynamics and varying\ninformation gathering latencies, it is extremely challenging to observe and\ncollect all trust attributes of a collaborating device concurrently for a\ncomprehensive trust assessment. In this paper, a novel progressive trust\nevaluation framework, namely chain-of-trust, is proposed to make better use of\nmisaligned device attribute data. This framework, designed for effective task\ncompletion, divides the trust evaluation process into multiple chained stages\nbased on task decomposition. At each stage, based on the task completion\nprocess, the framework only gathers the latest device attribute data relevant\nto that stage, leading to reduced trust evaluation complexity and overhead. By\nleveraging advanced in-context learning, few-shot learning, and reasoning\ncapabilities, generative AI is then employed to analyze and interpret the\ncollected data to produce correct evaluation results quickly. Only devices\ndeemed trustworthy at this stage proceed to the next round of trust evaluation.\nThe framework ultimately determines devices that remain trustworthy across all\nstages.

With MedPerturb, we release a dataset of 800 clinical contexts\ngrounded in realistic input variability, outputs from four LLMs, and three\nhuman expert reads per clinical context. We use MedPerturb in two case studies\nto reveal how shifts in gender identity cues, language style, or format reflect\ndiverging treatment selections between humans and LLMs. We find that LLMs are\nmore sensitive to gender and style perturbations while human annotators are\nmore sensitive to LLM-generated format perturbations such as clinical\nsummaries.
