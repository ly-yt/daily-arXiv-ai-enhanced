This expressivity and richness\ncome at a cost: ABMs can typically be analyzed only through simulation, making\ntheir analysis challenging. Specifically, when studying the output of ABMs, the\nanalyst is often confronted with practical questions such as: (i) how many\nindependent replications should be run? (ii) how many initial time steps should\nbe discarded as a warm-up? (iii) after the warm-up, how long should the model\nrun? (iv) what are the right parameter values? Analysts usually resort to rules\nof thumb and experimentation, which lack statistical rigor. This is mainly\nbecause addressing these points takes time, and analysts prefer to spend their\nlimited time improving the model. In this paper, we propose a methodology,\ndrawing on the field of Statistical Model Checking, to automate the process and\nprovide guarantees of statistical rigor for ABMs written in NetLogo, one of the\nmost popular ABM platforms.

This\nfoundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of\n\\emph{possibility} and \\emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal\nlogic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make\ninfere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for\nproper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively\nguide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from\nreaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity\nsimulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses\ncomplex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs\nwith the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world\nmodel and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable\nautonomous agents."}

This paper\ncritically re-evaluates the necessity and optimality of this agent-centric\nparadigm. We argue that its persistent conceptual ambiguities and inherent\nanthropocentric biases may represent a limiting framework. We distinguish\nbetween agentic systems (AI inspired by agency, often semi-autonomous, e.g.,\nLLM-based agents), agential systems (fully autonomous, self-producing systems,\ncurrently only biological), and non-agentic systems (tools without the\nimpression of agency). Our analysis, based on a systematic review of relevant\nliterature, deconstructs the agent paradigm across various AI frameworks,\nhighlighting challenges in defining and measuring properties like autonomy and\ngoal-directedness. We argue that the 'agentic' framing of many AI systems,\nwhile heuristically useful, can be misleading and may obscure the underlying\ncomputational mechanisms, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). As an\nalternative, we propose a shift in focus towards frameworks grounded in\nsystem-level dynamics, world modeling, and material intelligence.

The dynamics contract toward a stable configuration of complementary\nroles, and self-similarity networks reveal a small-world architecture with\nefficient long-range connectivity and specialized bridging motifs, clarifying\nhow local novelties consolidate into global musical form. By shifting\nspecialization from parameter updates to interaction rules, shared memory, and\ndynamic consensus, MusicSwarm provides a compute- and data-efficient route to\nlong-horizon creative structure that is immediately transferable beyond music\nto collaborative writing, design, and scientific discovery."}

This paper presents a systematic review of Human-AI collaboration\npatterns that support decision-making across all disaster management phases.\nDrawing from 51 peer-reviewed studies, we identify four major categories:\nHuman-AI Decision Support Systems, Task and Resource Coordination, Trust and\nTransparency, and Simulation and Training. Within these, we analyze\nsub-patterns such as cognitive-augmented intelligence, multi-agent\ncoordination, explainable AI, and virtual training environments. Our review\nhighlights how AI systems may enhance situational awareness, improves response\nefficiency, and support complex decision-making, while also surfacing critical\nlimitations in scalability, interpretability, and system interoperability. We\nconclude by outlining key challenges and future research directions,\nemphasizing the need for adaptive, trustworthy, and context-aware Human-AI\nsystems to improve disaster resilience and equitable recovery outcomes."}

We attribute this\nvulnerability to the difficulty of MLLMs maintaining safety alignment through\nlong-chain reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce\nSafe-Semantics-but-Unsafe-Interpretation (SSUI), the first dataset featuring\ninterpretable reasoning paths tailored for such a cross-modal challenge. A\nnovel training framework, Safety-aware Reasoning Path Optimization (SRPO), is\nalso designed based on the SSUI dataset to align the MLLM's internal reasoning\nprocess with human safety values. Experimental results show that our\nSRPO-trained models achieve state-of-the-art results on key safety benchmarks,\nincluding the proposed Reasoning Path Benchmark (RSBench), significantly\noutperforming both open-source and top-tier commercial MLLMs."}

This\nlimits their ability to evaluate whether a given system variant can fulfill\nspecific tasks and how efficiently it performs compared to alternatives.\n  To address this gap, this paper presents a model-driven method that enables\nthe specification and automated generation of symbolic planning artifacts\nwithin SysML-based engineering models. A dedicated SysML profile introduces\nreusable stereotypes for core planning constructs. These are integrated into\nexisting model structures and processed by an algorithm that generates a valid\ndomain file and a corresponding problem file in Planning Domain Definition\nLanguage (PDDL). In contrast to previous approaches that rely on manual\ntransformations or external capability models, the method supports native\nintegration and maintains consistency between engineering and planning\nartifacts.\n  The applicability of the method is demonstrated through a case study from\naircraft assembly. The example illustrates how existing engineering models are\nenriched with planning semantics and how the proposed workflow is applied to\ngenerate consistent planning artifacts from these models. The generated\nplanning artifacts enable the validation of system variants through AI\nplanning."}

However, prior AI\nevaluations have focused on final diagnoses without addressing the multifaceted\nreasoning and presentation skills required of expert discussants.\n  METHODS: Using 7102 CPCs (1923-2025) and 1021 Image Challenges (2006-2025),\nwe conducted extensive physician annotation and automated processing to create\nCPC-Bench, a physician-validated benchmark spanning 10 text-based and\nmultimodal tasks, against which we evaluated leading large language models\n(LLMs). Then, we developed \"Dr. CaBot,\" an AI discussant designed to produce\nwritten and slide-based video presentations using only the case presentation,\nmodeling the role of the human expert in these cases.\n  RESULTS: When challenged with 377 contemporary CPCs, o3 (OpenAI) ranked the\nfinal diagnosis first in 60% of cases and within the top ten in 84% of cases,\noutperforming a 20-physician baseline; next-test selection accuracy reached\n98%. Event-level physician annotations quantified AI diagnostic accuracy per\nunit of information. Performance was lower on literature search and image\ntasks; o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google) achieved 67% accuracy on image\nchallenges. In blinded comparisons of CaBot vs. human expert-generated text,\nphysicians misclassified the source of the differential in 46 of 62 (74%) of\ntrials, and scored CaBot more favorably across quality dimensions. To promote\nresearch, we are releasing CaBot and CPC-Bench.\n  CONCLUSIONS: LLMs exceed physician performance on complex text-based\ndifferential diagnosis and convincingly emulate expert medical presentations,\nbut image interpretation and literature retrieval remain weaker. CPC-Bench and\nCaBot may enable transparent and continued tracking of progress in medical AI."}
