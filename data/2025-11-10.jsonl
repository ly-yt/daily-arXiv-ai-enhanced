Reject-option\nprediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction\nuncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on\naleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes\nthe epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios,\nlimited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the\nepistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic\nuncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we\nredefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the\nperformance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with\nfull knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for\na given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of\nidentifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable\ndecisions."}

We introduce Dynamic\nMemory Alignment (DMA), an online learning framework that systematically\nincorporates multi-granularity human feedback to align ranking in interactive\nsettings. DMA organizes document-, list-, and response-level signals into a\ncoherent learning pipeline: supervised training for pointwise and listwise\nrankers, policy optimization driven by response-level preferences, and\nknowledge distillation into a lightweight scorer for low-latency serving.\nThroughout this paper, memory refers to the model's working memory, which is\nthe entire context visible to the LLM for In-Context Learning.\n  We adopt a dual-track evaluation protocol mirroring deployment: (i)\nlarge-scale online A/B ablations to isolate the utility of each feedback\nsource, and (ii) few-shot offline tests on knowledge-intensive benchmarks.\nOnline, a multi-month industrial deployment further shows substantial\nimprovements in human engagement. Offline, DMA preserves competitive\nfoundational retrieval while yielding notable gains on conversational QA\n(TriviaQA, HotpotQA).

This requires continuous awareness of the dynamic environment:\nhazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act, while the agent's\nreasoning is still unfolding. Despite advances in language model reasoning,\nexisting approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature. We introduce\nreal-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving\nenvironments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two\nparadigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which\nemploy language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses,\nand (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex\nproblems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with\nmaking logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this\nlimitation, we propose AgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both\nreasoning paradigms. AgileThinker consistently outperforms agents engaging only\none reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise,\neffectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency. Our work\nestablishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for developing practical\nagents and provides a foundation for research in temporally constrained AI\nsystems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents."}

We demo ORCHID, a modular agentic\nsystem for HRP classification that pairs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\nwith human oversight to produce policy-based outputs that can be audited. Small\ncooperating agents, retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, and\nfeedback logger, coordinate via agent-to-agent messaging and invoke tools\nthrough the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-agnostic on-premise\noperation.

It systematically produces\nthousands of individual action alternatives, followed by evaluations aimed at\nidentifying alternative courses of action with superior outcomes. These\nalternatives are appraised in light of the opponent's status and actions,\nconsidering unit composition, force ratios, types of offense and defense, and\nanticipated advance rates.

We demonstrate why planning decisions\nrequire explicit reasoning capabilities that are value-based (applying\nnormative principles), rule-grounded (guaranteeing constraint satisfaction),\nand explainable (generating transparent justifications) -- requirements that\nstatistical learning alone cannot fulfill. We compare reasoning agents with\nstatistical learning, present a comprehensive architecture with benchmark\nevaluation metrics, and outline critical research challenges.
