In the representative scenario of smart farming, planning efficient harvesting schedules for a fleet of electric robots presents a highly challenging frontier problem. The complexity arises not only from the need to find Pareto-optimal solutions for the conflicting objectives of makespan and transportation cost, but also from the necessity to simultaneously manage payload constraints and finite battery capacity. When robot loads are dynamically updated during planned multi-trip operations, a mandatory recharge triggered by energy constraints introduces an unscheduled load reset. This interaction creates a complex cascading effect that disrupts the entire schedule and renders traditional optimization methods ineffective. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the segment anchoring-based balancing algorithm (SABA). The core of SABA lies in the organic combination of two synergistic mechanisms: the sequential anchoring and balancing mechanism, which leverages charging decisions as `anchors' to systematically reconstruct disrupted routes, while the proportional splitting-based rebalancing mechanism is responsible for the fine-grained balancing and tuning of the final solutions' makespans. Extensive comparative experiments, conducted on a real-world case study and a suite of benchmark instances, demonstrate that SABA comprehensively outperforms 6 state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both solution convergence and diversity. This research provides a novel theoretical perspective and an effective solution for the multi-robot task allocation problem under energy constraints."}

This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images.

Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models."}

Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\\% precision.

This phenomenon results in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradients, significantly hindering algorithm convergence and performance improvement. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Hybrid Differential Reward (HDR) mechanism. We first theoretically elucidate how the temporal quasi-steady nature of traffic states and the physical proximity of actions lead to the failure of traditional reward signals. Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety."}

However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning."}

For these agents, scaling involves not only \"thinking\" in tokens but also \"acting\" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack \"budget awareness\" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to \"dig deeper\" on a promising lead or \"pivot\" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents."}

However, this formulation fails to explain its practical behavior: the prior offers limited guidance, while reconstruction is largely driven by the measurement-consistency term, leading to an inference process that is effectively decoupled from the diffusion dynamics. To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \\textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice. By requiring fewer function evaluations (NFEs) and measurement-optimization steps, \\textbf{DAPS++} achieves high computational efficiency and robust reconstruction performance across diverse image restoration tasks."}

To leverage the potential of such systems in high-risk applications, we need large, structured tabular datasets on which we can build transparent feature-based models.

In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data. We show the potential of our method on the SimSUM dataset, a simulated benchmark linking tabular EHRs with clinical notes through expert knowledge."}

The ontology ensures semantic precision and reusability by aligning with foundational ontologies and best practices in modular design. Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states. Together, these experiments illustrate how the BDI Ontology acts as both a conceptual and operational bridge between declarative and procedural intelligence, paving the way for cognitively grounded, explainable, and semantically interoperable multi-agent and neuro-symbolic systems operating within the Web of Data."}

While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards.

Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems."}

However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring."}

However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness."}
