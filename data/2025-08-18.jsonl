Training-Free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents via LLM-Guided Program Synthesis in Dynamic Environments", "comment": "Under Review", "summary": "Autonomous agents in safety-critical applications must continuously adapt to\ndynamic conditions without compromising performance and reliability. This work\nintroduces TAPA (Training-free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents), a novel\nframework that positions large language models (LLMs) as intelligent moderators\nof the symbolic action space. Unlike prior programmatic agents that typically\ngenerate a monolithic policy program or rely on fixed symbolic action sets,\nTAPA synthesizes and adapts modular programs for individual high-level actions,\nreferred to as logical primitives. By decoupling strategic intent from\nexecution, TAPA enables meta-agents to operate over an abstract, interpretable\naction space while the LLM dynamically generates, composes, and refines\nsymbolic programs tailored to each primitive. Extensive experiments across\ncybersecurity and swarm intelligence domains validate TAPA's effectiveness. In\nautonomous DDoS defense scenarios, TAPA achieves 77.7% network uptime while\nmaintaining near-perfect detection accuracy in unknown dynamic environments. In\nswarm intelligence formation control under environmental and adversarial\ndisturbances, TAPA consistently preserves consensus at runtime where baseline\nmethods fail completely.

Although first-order rules are commonly used in ASPIC+ examples, most\nexisting approaches to reason over rule-based argumentation only support\npropositional rules. To enable reasoning over first-order instances, a\npreliminary grounding step is required. As groundings can lead to an\nexponential increase in the size of the input theories, intelligent procedures\nare needed.

In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals\nwith actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven\ndecisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual\n(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world\napplications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing\noutcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the\ninherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact\nand compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel\nframework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple\nrecourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction\nas a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided\nby both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse\ncosts, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap\nbetween individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a\nthree-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal\ncapacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware\noptimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.\nExperimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that\nour framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve\nnear-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings.

To achieve this,\nexperience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally\nexpensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts\nhave been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most\ntime-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on\ntheory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and\nintegrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to\nautomatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning\ntime. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by\nlearning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we\nintegrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed\nfor LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability\nissue of existing L2O methods. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop\nvirtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy\nnetwork, and the dose predictor is used to initialize objective parameters. The\ninner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable MU values based\non objectives refined by the PPO policy network. 97 patients are collected in\nthis study, and compared with L-BFGSB, our L2O-based inverse optimizer improves\nthe effectiveness and efficiency by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively.

To do so, we use abstract bipolar set-based argumentation\nframeworks (BSAFs) as formal playground since they concisely capture the\nrelations between assumptions and are expressive enough to represent general\nnon-flat ABA frameworks, as recently shown. While weak admissibility has been\nrecently investigated for a restricted fragment of ABA in which assumptions\ncannot be derived (flat ABA), strong admissibility has not been investigated\nfor ABA so far.

Recent studies have demonstrated that Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) can effectively enhance agents' performance in dynamic\ninteractive GUI environments.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose CRAFT-GUI, a curriculum learning framework based on\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that explicitly accounts for the\nvarying difficulty across trajectories.
