Recently, agentic frameworks have demonstrated\nsignificant potential for automating inspection workflows but have been limited\nto digital tasks. Their application to physical assets in real-world\nenvironments, however, remains underexplored. In this work, our contributions\nare two-fold: first, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework for autonomous\ndrone control, and second, a reasoning methodology for individual function\nexecutions which we refer to as ReActEval. Our framework focuses on visual\ninspection tasks in indoor industrial settings, such as interpreting industrial\nreadouts or inspecting equipment. It employs a multi-agent system comprising a\nhead agent and multiple worker agents, each controlling a single drone. The\nhead agent performs high-level planning and evaluates outcomes, while worker\nagents implement ReActEval to reason over and execute low-level actions.\nOperating entirely in natural language, ReActEval follows a plan, reason, act,\nevaluate cycle, enabling drones to handle tasks ranging from simple navigation\n(e.g., flying forward 10 meters and land) to complex high-level tasks (e.g.,\nlocating and reading a pressure gauge). The evaluation phase serves as a\nfeedback and/or replanning stage, ensuring actions align with user objectives\nwhile preventing undesirable outcomes. We evaluate the framework in a simulated\nenvironment with two worker agents, assessing performance qualitatively and\nquantitatively based on task completion across varying complexity levels and\nworkflow efficiency. By leveraging natural language processing for agent\ncommunication, our approach offers a novel, flexible, and user-accessible\nalternative to traditional drone-based solutions, enabling autonomous\nproblem-solving for industrial inspection without extensive user intervention."}

We prove system convergence to stable\ncoordination patterns when step sizes satisfy $\\alpha < \\frac{1}{2L}$ where $L$\nis the Lipschitz constant of the state transition function. We implement this\nthrough a distributed architecture that dynamically routes reasoning tasks\nwhile maintaining semantic coherence.\n  Experimental results on 1,000 synthetic multi-agent conversations demonstrate\na 42% reduction in reasoning latency, a 23% improvement in logical consistency\nmeasured by ROUGE-L score, and an 89% success rate for task completion without\ncontext loss across agent transitions.

Specifically, optimizing the communication structure\nbetween agents is critical for fruitful collaboration. Most existing approaches\nrely on fixed topologies, pretrained graph generators, optimization over edges,\nor employ external LLM judges, thereby adding to the complexity. In this work,\nwe introduce a response-conditioned framework that adapts communication\non-the-fly. Agents independently generate responses to the user query and\nassess peer contributions using an approximation of the Shapley value. A\ndirected acyclic graph (DAG) is then constructed to regulate the propagation of\nthe responses among agents, which ensures stable and efficient message\ntransmission from high-contributing agents to others. This graph is dynamically\nupdated based on the agent responses from the previous collaboration round.\nSince the proposed framework enables the self-organization of agents without\nadditional supervision or training, we refer to it as SelfOrg.

Unlike\nprior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a\nmodular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental\nevaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%\nimprovement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client\ndropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,\nprivacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These\nfindings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy\nfederated diagnosis of rare conditions."}

A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts\nhigh-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while\nhorizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,\nWMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused\ninsights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias\ndecomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family\nhotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A\ntrend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,\nflags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points\naligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal\nfactors.

The rapid advancement of\ntransformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of\ncomputational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training\ndatasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are\nmost crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.\nFurther, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring\nrepresentational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores\nunreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming\nuseful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set\nof over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a\ntriplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences\nfor measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS\ndatabase.

A major drawback of these tools is their\nreliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to\nout-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the\nexplanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires\ndomain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm\nActivation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input\nfeatures from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the\nmodel that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in\nmechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust\nexplanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the\nConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We\nprovide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model\narchitectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations\nachieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,\nand confidence drop-off.

Three solution\nstrategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared\nacross multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through\n16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining\nquantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results\nindicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible\nproduction plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation\nsignificantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline\napproaches.

Our framework focuses on visual\ninspection tasks in indoor industrial settings, such as interpreting industrial\nreadouts or inspecting equipment.
