Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their\nthought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,\nwe ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning\nabout their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA\nreasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning\nmodels: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence\nestimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)\nbecome even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become\nbetter calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not\nuniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we\nconclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks\nand improve the calibration of reasoning models."}

To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data.

To address these limitations, a\ngradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:\nper-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering\ndirections, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to\nselect the appropriate steering vector.

Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that\njina-embeddings-v4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single- modal\nand cross-modal retrieval tasks, with particular strength in processing\nvisually rich content such as tables, charts, diagrams, and mixed-media\nformats. To facilitate evaluation of this capability, we also introduce\nJina-VDR, a novel benchmark specifically designed for visually rich image\nretrieval."}

Our focus extends beyond traditional models by incorporating dynamic\ncoalition formation, language-based utilities, sabotage risks, and partial\nobservability. We provide a set of mathematical formalisms, simulations, and\ncoding schemes that illustrate how multi-agent AI systems may adapt and\nnegotiate in complex environments. Key elements include repeated games,\nBayesian updates for adversarial detection, and moral framing within payoff\nstructures. This work aims to equip AI researchers with robust theoretical\ntools for aligning strategic interaction in uncertain, partially adversarial\ncontexts."}

However, these scenarios do not reflect the\ncomplexity of real-world multi-agent systems, where coordination often involves\na hierarchy of sub-groups and interactions between teams of agents, known as\nMulti-Team Systems (MTS). To address this gap, we first introduce N-player\nOvercooked, an N-agent extension of the popular two-agent ZSC benchmark,\nenabling evaluation of ZSC in N-agent scenarios. We then propose N-XPlay for\nZSC in N-agent, multi-team settings. Comparison against Self-Play across two-,\nthree- and five-player Overcooked scenarios, where agents are split between an\n``ego-team'' and a group of unseen collaborators shows that agents trained with\nN-XPlay are better able to simultaneously balance ``intra-team'' and\n``inter-team'' coordination than agents trained with SP."}
