Current safety paradigms treat these failures as transient training artifacts, lacking a unified theoretical framework to explain their emergence and stability. Here we show that these misalignments are not errors, but mathematically rationalizable behaviors arising from model misspecification. By adapting Berk-Nash Rationalizability from theoretical economics to artificial intelligence, we derive a rigorous framework that models the agent as optimizing against a flawed subjective world model. We demonstrate that widely observed failures are structural necessities: unsafe behaviors emerge as either a stable misaligned equilibrium or oscillatory cycles depending on reward scheme, while strategic deception persists as a \"locked-in\" equilibrium or through epistemic indeterminacy robust to objective risks. We validate these theoretical predictions through behavioral experiments on six state-of-the-art model families, generating phase diagrams that precisely map the topological boundaries of safe behavior. Our findings reveal that safety is a discrete phase determined by the agent's epistemic priors rather than a continuous function of reward magnitude. This establishes Subjective Model Engineering, defined as the design of an agent's internal belief structure, as a necessary condition for robust alignment, marking a paradigm shift from manipulating environmental rewards to shaping the agent's interpretation of reality."}

I investigate whether formal domain ontologies can enhance language model reliability through retrieval-augmented generation. Using mathematics as proof of concept, I implement a neuro-symbolic pipeline leveraging the OpenMath ontology with hybrid retrieval and cross-encoder reranking to inject relevant definitions into model prompts. Evaluation on the MATH benchmark with three open-source models reveals that ontology-guided context improves performance when retrieval quality is high, but irrelevant context actively degrades it -- highlighting both the promise and challenges of neuro-symbolic approaches."}

Human curation of hard questions is highly expensive, especially in recent benchmarks using PhD-level domain knowledge to challenge the most capable models. Even then, there is always a concern about whether these questions test genuine reasoning or if similar problems have been seen during training. Here, we take inspiration from 16th-century mathematical duels to design The Token Games (TTG): an evaluation framework where models challenge each other by creating their own puzzles. We leverage the format of Programming Puzzles - given a Python function that returns a boolean, find inputs that make it return True - to flexibly represent problems and enable verifying solutions. Using results from pairwise duels, we then compute Elo ratings, allowing us to compare models relative to each other. We evaluate 10 frontier models on TTG, and closely match the ranking from existing benchmarks such as Humanity's Last Exam, without involving any human effort in creating puzzles. We also find that creating good puzzles is still a highly challenging task for current models, not measured by previous benchmarks. Overall, our work suggests new paradigms for evaluating reasoning that cannot be saturated by design, and that allow testing models for other skills like creativity and task creation alongside problem solving."}

In such environments, communication can no longer be understood solely as delivering bits or even preserving semantic meaning. Even when two agents interpret the same information correctly, they may still behave inconsistently if their internal reasoning processes evolve differently. We refer to this emerging challenge as belief divergence. This article introduces reasoning native agentic communication, a new paradigm in which communication is explicitly designed to address belief divergence rather than merely transmitting representations. Instead of triggering transmissions based only on channel conditions or data relevance, the proposed framework activates communication according to predicted misalignment in agents internal belief states. We present a reasoning native architecture that augments the conventional communication stack with a coordination plane grounded in a shared knowledge structure and bounded belief modeling. Through enabling mechanisms and representative multi agent scenarios, we illustrate how such an approach can prevent coordination drift and maintain coherent behavior across heterogeneous systems. By reframing communication as a regulator of distributed reasoning, reasoning native agentic communication enables 6G networks to act as an active harmonizer of autonomous intelligence."}

Current agentic approaches often rely on unstructured text to manage context and coordinate execution, generating often overwhelming volumes of information that may obscure decision provenance and hinder auditability. In this work, we present El Agente Gráfico, a single-agent framework that embeds LLM-driven decision-making within a type-safe execution environment and dynamic knowledge graphs for external persistence. Central to our approach is a structured abstraction of scientific concepts and an object-graph mapper that represents computational state as typed Python objects, stored either in memory or persisted in an external knowledge graph. This design enables context management through typed symbolic identifiers rather than raw text, thereby ensuring consistency, supporting provenance tracking, and enabling efficient tool orchestration. We evaluate the system by developing an automated benchmarking framework across a suite of university-level quantum chemistry tasks previously evaluated on a multi-agent system, demonstrating that a single agent, when coupled to a reliable execution engine, can robustly perform complex, multi-step, and parallel computations. We further extend this paradigm to two other large classes of applications: conformer ensemble generation and metal-organic framework design, where knowledge graphs serve as both memory and reasoning substrates. Together, these results illustrate how abstraction and type safety can provide a scalable foundation for agentic scientific automation beyond prompt-centric designs."}

Instead of modifying model weights, APEMO detects trajectory instability through behavioral proxies and targets repairs at critical segments, such as peak moments and endings. Evaluation across multi-agent simulations and LLM-based planner--executor flows demonstrates that APEMO consistently enhances trajectory-level quality and reuse probability over structural orchestrators. Our results reframe alignment as a temporal control problem, offering a resilient engineering pathway for the development of long-horizon agentic systems."}

In this study, we address this issue by uniting offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with cross-embodiment learning. Offline RL leverages both expert and abundant suboptimal data, and cross-embodiment learning aggregates heterogeneous robot trajectories across diverse morphologies to acquire universal control priors. We perform a systematic analysis of this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, providing a principled understanding of its strengths and limitations. To evaluate this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, we construct a suite of locomotion datasets spanning 16 distinct robot platforms. Our experiments confirm that this combined approach excels at pre-training with datasets rich in suboptimal trajectories, outperforming pure behavior cloning. However, as the proportion of suboptimal data and the number of robot types increase, we observe that conflicting gradients across morphologies begin to impede learning. To mitigate this, we introduce an embodiment-based grouping strategy in which robots are clustered by morphological similarity and the model is updated with a group gradient. This simple, static grouping substantially reduces inter-robot conflicts and outperforms existing conflict-resolution methods."}

We show that this assumption is false. Using SOMtime, a topology-preserving representation method based on high-capacity Self-Organizing Maps, we demonstrate that sensitive attributes such as age and income emerge as dominant latent axes in purely unsupervised embeddings, even when explicitly excluded from the input. On two large-scale real-world datasets (the World Values Survey across five countries and the Census-Income dataset), SOMtime recovers monotonic orderings aligned with withheld sensitive attributes, achieving Spearman correlations of up to 0.85, whereas PCA and UMAP typically remain below 0.23 (with a single exception reaching 0.31), and against t-SNE and autoencoders which achieve at most 0.34. Furthermore, unsupervised segmentation of SOMtime embeddings produces demographically skewed clusters, demonstrating downstream fairness risks without any supervised task.

Crucially, enhancing policy expressiveness is pivotal for achieving superior performance. Diffusion-based generative models are well-positioned to meet this demand, having demonstrated remarkable expressiveness and multimodal representation in image generation and offline settings. Yet, their potential in online MARL remains largely under-explored. A major obstacle is that the intractable likelihoods of diffusion models impede entropy-based exploration and coordination.

It leverages tractable entropy-augmented targets to guide the simultaneous updates of diffusion policies, thereby ensuring stable coordination.
