Plans are a central component of BDI\nagents, and define sequences of actions that an agent must undertake to achieve\na certain goal. Existing approaches to plan generation often require\nsignificant manual effort, and are mainly focused on single-agent systems. As a\nresult, in this work, we have developed a tool that automatically generates BDI\nplans using Alternating-Time Temporal Logic (ATL). By using ATL, the plans\ngenerated accommodate for possible competition or cooperation between the\nagents in the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool by\ngenerating plans for an illustrative game that requires agent collaboration to\nachieve a shared goal. We show that the generated plans allow the agents to\nsuccessfully attain this goal."}

Although several MAPF methods which\nsolve full-horizon MAPF have completeness guarantees, very few MAPF methods\nthat plan partial paths have completeness guarantees. Recent work introduced\nthe Windowed Complete MAPF (WinC-MAPF) framework, which shows how windowed\noptimal MAPF solvers (e.g., SS-CBS) can use heuristic updates and disjoint\nagent groups to maintain completeness even when planning partial paths\n(Veerapaneni et al. 2024). A core limitation of WinC-MAPF is that they required\noptimal MAPF solvers. Our main contribution is to extend WinC-MAPF by showing\nhow we can use a bounded suboptimal solver while maintaining completeness. In\nparticular, we design Dynamic Agent Grouping ECBS (DAG-ECBS) which dynamically\ncreates and plans agent groups while maintaining that each agent group solution\nis bounded suboptimal.

Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its\nmisaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires\ndifferent strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing\nanti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme\non far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming\nis driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to\npre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of \"covert actions\" --\nsuch as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as\na proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then\nstress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our\nmitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal\npreviously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after\nadditional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often\ndemonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal\nevidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness\nincreases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in\ncovert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness.\nWhile we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational\nawareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to\nrely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard\nEnglish. We encourage research into alignment mitigations for scheming and\ntheir assessment, especially for the adversarial case of deceptive alignment,\nwhich this paper does not address."}

Plans are a central component of BDI\nagents, and define sequences of actions that an agent must undertake to achieve\na certain goal. Existing approaches to plan generation often require\nsignificant manual effort, and are mainly focused on single-agent systems. As a\nresult, in this work, we have developed a tool that automatically generates BDI\nplans using Alternating-Time Temporal Logic (ATL). By using ATL, the plans\ngenerated accommodate for possible competition or cooperation between the\nagents in the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the tool by\ngenerating plans for an illustrative game that requires agent collaboration to\nachieve a shared goal. We show that the generated plans allow the agents to\nsuccessfully attain this goal."}
