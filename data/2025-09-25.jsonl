To Appear at ECAI 2025", "summary": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a growing research area which\ngained significant traction in recent years, extending Deep RL applications to\na much wider range of problems. A particularly challenging class of problems in\nthis domain is Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HeMARL), where\nagents with different sensors, resources, or capabilities must cooperate based\non local information. The large number of real-world situations involving\nheterogeneous agents makes it an attractive research area, yet underexplored,\nas most MARL research focuses on homogeneous agents (e.g., a swarm of identical\nrobots). In MARL and single-agent RL, standardized environments such as ALE and\nSMAC have allowed to establish recognized benchmarks to measure progress.\nHowever, there is a clear lack of such standardized testbed for cooperative\nHeMARL. As a result, new research in this field often uses simple environments,\nwhere most algorithms perform near optimally, or uses weakly heterogeneous MARL\nenvironments."}

This limitation leads to inefficient task\nrouting, particularly in dynamic environments where agent capabilities\ncontinuously evolve. We introduce Knowledge Base-Aware (KBA) Orchestration, a\nnovel approach that augments static descriptions with dynamic,\nprivacy-preserving relevance signals derived from each agent's internal\nknowledge base (KB). In the proposed framework, when static descriptions are\ninsufficient for a clear routing decision, the orchestrator prompts the\nsubagents in parallel. Each agent then assesses the task's relevance against\nits private KB, returning a lightweight ACK signal without exposing the\nunderlying data. These collected signals populate a shared semantic cache,\nproviding dynamic indicators of agent suitability for future queries. By\ncombining this novel mechanism with static descriptions, our method achieves\nmore accurate and adaptive task routing preserving agent autonomy and data\nconfidentiality. Benchmarks show that our KBA Orchestration significantly\noutperforms static description-driven methods in routing precision and overall\nsystem efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale systems that require\nhigher accuracy than standard description-driven routing."}

Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer\nfrom high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due\nto unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these\nchallenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL)\nparadigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an\nalternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in\nwhich a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously\nminimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme --\nin other words, being \"easy\" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL\nand design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation,\nconditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can\nbe different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis\nand empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation\naccuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme\nwithin EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an\nassessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical\nresults across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that\nEvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive\nreturns.

However, existing methods are often\nconstrained to a single, fixed trade-off between competing objectives such as\nadversariality and realism. This yields behavior-specific models that cannot be\nsteered at inference time, lacking the efficiency and flexibility to generate\ntailored scenarios for diverse training and testing requirements. In view of\nthis, we reframe the task of adversarial scenario generation as a\nmulti-objective preference alignment problem and introduce a new framework\nnamed \\textbf{S}teerable \\textbf{A}dversarial scenario \\textbf{GE}nerator\n(SAGE). SAGE enables fine-grained test-time control over the trade-off between\nadversariality and realism without any retraining. We first propose\nhierarchical group-based preference optimization, a data-efficient offline\nalignment method that learns to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard\nfeasibility constraints from soft preferences. Instead of training a fixed\nmodel, SAGE fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a\ncontinuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating\ntheir weights. We provide theoretical justification for this framework through\nthe lens of linear mode connectivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nSAGE not only generates scenarios with a superior balance of adversariality and\nrealism but also enables more effective closed-loop training of driving\npolicies.

This limitation leads to inefficient task\nrouting, particularly in dynamic environments where agent capabilities\ncontinuously evolve. We introduce Knowledge Base-Aware (KBA) Orchestration, a\nnovel approach that augments static descriptions with dynamic,\nprivacy-preserving relevance signals derived from each agent's internal\nknowledge base (KB). In the proposed framework, when static descriptions are\ninsufficient for a clear routing decision, the orchestrator prompts the\nsubagents in parallel. Each agent then assesses the task's relevance against\nits private KB, returning a lightweight ACK signal without exposing the\nunderlying data. These collected signals populate a shared semantic cache,\nproviding dynamic indicators of agent suitability for future queries. By\ncombining this novel mechanism with static descriptions, our method achieves\nmore accurate and adaptive task routing preserving agent autonomy and data\nconfidentiality. Benchmarks show that our KBA Orchestration significantly\noutperforms static description-driven methods in routing precision and overall\nsystem efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale systems that require\nhigher accuracy than standard description-driven routing."}
