Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently\nencounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital\nenvironments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs\nthe modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for\nassisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to\nan understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and\nreceives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description.\nMATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as\nhealthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The\nsystem supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using\ncustom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the\nsystem can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of\nhardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy\nand security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be\neffectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital\nhealthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce\nModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise\nmodality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that\nModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical\nmodels on our custom data.

Existing studies have gradually advocated collaborative governance but\nrely on macro-level theoretical analyses. This study integrates micro- and\nmacro-level perspectives to propose a two-stage, multi-scenario governance\nmechanism for cyber violence. In the first phase, a multi-scenario evolutionary\ngame model with four parties involved in cyber violence was developed based on\nevolutionary game theory. Matlab simulations show that under strong government\nregulation, moderate levels of punishment implemented by the government against\nthe online media that adopt misguidance strategies can achieve the most\ndesirable stable state. In the second phase, the role of bystanders was\nintroduced by integrating communication dynamics theory, and emotional factors\nwere considered alongside game strategies. This led to the development of a new\nSBI1I2R model for public opinion dissemination in cyber violence. Netlogo\nsimulations found that increasing the \"correct guidance\" strategy by the online\nmedia reduces the influence of cyber violence supporters and the time it takes\nfor their nodes to drop to zero, but does not significantly shorten the time\nfor the peak to occur. Comparatively, collaborative intervention between the\nonline media and the government was most effective in curbing public opinion,\nfollowed by the government's independent \"strong regulation.\" Relying solely on\nthe online media's \"correct guidance\" produced the weakest effect. Finally,\nthis mechanism was applied to a case study, and a multi-stage, multi-scenario\nanalysis based on life cycle theory enhanced its practical applicability."}

(2025), titled The Illusion of Thinking:\nUnderstanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of\nProblem Complexity, presents a compelling empirical finding, a reasoning cliff,\nwhere the performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) collapses beyond a\nspecific complexity threshold, which the authors posit as an intrinsic scaling\nlimitation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion\nof thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a\nconsequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action."}

Previous work\nwere mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some\npredefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of\nthe original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,\nthey largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of\nsubregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and\nsimilar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the\ncoarsened graph. By combining the multi-granularity characteristics of the\ngraph structure, we can generate coarsened graph at the optimal granularity. To\nthis end, inspired by the application of granular-ball computing in\nmulti-granularity, we propose a new multi-granularity, efficient, and adaptive\ncoarsening method via granular-ball (GBGC), which significantly improves the\ncoarsening results and efficiency. Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive\ngranular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original\ngraph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal\ngranularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as\nsupernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening\nmethods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to\nhundreds of times and has lower time complexity.

In\nextensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both\nautomatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG\nsignificantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based\nGraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria. Quantitatively, CID-GraphRAG\ndemonstrates substantial improvements over Conversation RAG across automatic\nmetrics, with relative gains of 11% in BLEU, 5% in ROUGE-L, 6% in METEOR, and\nmost notably, a 58% improvement in response quality according to LLM-as-judge\nevaluations. These results demonstrate that the integration of intent\ntransition structures with semantic retrieval creates a synergistic effect that\nneither approach achieves independently, establishing CID-GraphRAG as an\neffective framework for addressing the challenges of maintaining contextual\ncoherence and goal-oriented progression in knowledge-intensive multi-turn\ndialogues."}

The\nefficiency of an agent's exploration hinges on accurately identifying the\ncurrent task. Recent Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL approaches often rely on\nreconstructing the environment's reward signal, which is challenging in sparse\nreward settings, leading to suboptimal exploitation. Inspired by bisimulation\nmetrics, which robustly extracts behavioral similarity in continuous MDPs, we\npropose SimBelief-a novel meta-RL framework via measuring similarity of task\nbelief in Bayes-Adaptive MDP (BAMDP). SimBelief effectively extracts common\nfeatures of similar task distributions, enabling efficient task identification\nand exploration in sparse reward environments. We introduce latent task belief\nmetric to learn the common structure of similar tasks and incorporate it into\nthe specific task belief. By learning the latent dynamics across task\ndistributions, we connect shared latent task belief features with specific task\nfeatures, facilitating rapid task identification and adaptation. Our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sparse reward MuJoCo and panda-gym\ntasks."}

While\nReinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its\noutcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the\nthinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address\nthe high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced\nRL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by\nintegrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL\ntraining process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL\nguides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality\nreward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping\nthem recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during\nRL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning\nstrategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning\nsteps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process.

The research\nfield of data visualization deals with defining principles and guidelines for\nthe creation and use of these diagrams, which are often not known or adhered to\nby researchers, leading to misinformation caused by providing inaccurate or\nincomplete information.\n  In this work, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) are used to analyze\ndiagrams in order to identify potential problems in regards to selected data\nvisualization principles and guidelines. To determine the suitability of VLMs\nfor these tasks, five open source VLMs and five prompting strategies are\ncompared using a set of questions derived from selected data visualization\nguidelines.\n  The results show that the employed VLMs work well to accurately analyze\ndiagram types (F1-score 82.49 %), 3D effects (F1-score 98.55 %), axes labels\n(F1-score 76.74 %), lines (RMSE 1.16), colors (RMSE 1.60) and legends (F1-score\n96.64 %, RMSE 0.70), while they cannot reliably provide feedback about the\nimage quality (F1-score 0.74 %) and tick marks/labels (F1-score 46.13 %). Among\nthe employed VLMs, Qwen2.5VL performs best, and the summarizing prompting\nstrategy performs best for most of the experimental questions.\n  It is shown that VLMs can be used to automatically identify a number of\npotential issues in diagrams, such as missing axes labels, missing legends, and\nunnecessary 3D effects. The approach laid out in this work can be extended for\nfurther aspects of data visualization."}

Accurate forecasts enableimprovedshipment planning, reducedelaysand\ncosts, and optimizeinventoryanddistributionstrategies, thereby ensuring timely\ndeliveries and enhancing supply chain resilience. To achieve accurate\npredictions, analyzing vessel behavior and their stay times at specific port\nterminals is essential, focusing particularly on berth scheduling under various\nconditions. Crucially, the model must capture and learn the underlying\npriorities and patterns of berth scheduling. Berth scheduling and planning are\ninfluenced by a range of factors, including incoming vessel size, waiting\ntimes, and the status of vessels within the port terminal. By observing\nhistorical Automatic Identification System (AIS) positions of vessels, we\nreconstruct berth schedules, which are subsequently utilized to determine the\nreward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). For this purpose, we\nmodeled a specific terminal at the Port of New York/New Jersey and developed\nTemporal-IRL. This Temporal-IRL model learns berth scheduling to predict vessel\nsequencing at the terminal and estimate vessel port stay, encompassing both\nwaiting and berthing times, to forecast port congestion.

However, joint evolution across heterogeneous\nagents remains challenging due to cooperative inefficiency and training\ninstability. In this paper, we propose the joint evolution dynamics for MARL\ncalled JoyAgents-R1, which first applies Group Relative Policy Optimization\n(GRPO) to the joint training of heterogeneous multi-agents. By iteratively\nrefining agents' large language models (LLMs) and memories, the method achieves\nholistic equilibrium with optimal decision-making and memory capabilities.\nSpecifically, JoyAgents-R1 first implements node-wise Monte Carlo sampling on\nthe behavior of each agent across entire reasoning trajectories to enhance GRPO\nsampling efficiency while maintaining policy diversity. Then, our marginal\nbenefit-driven selection strategy identifies top-$K$ sampling groups with\nmaximal reward fluctuations, enabling targeted agent model updates that improve\ntraining stability and maximize joint benefits through cost-effective parameter\nadjustments. Meanwhile, JoyAgents-R1 introduces an adaptive memory evolution\nmechanism that repurposes GRPO rewards as cost-free supervisory signals to\neliminate repetitive reasoning and accelerate convergence. Experiments across\ngeneral and domain-specific scenarios demonstrate that JoyAgents-R1 achieves\nperformance comparable to that of larger LLMs while built on smaller\nopen-source models."}

Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently\nencounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital\nenvironments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs\nthe modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for\nassisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to\nan understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and\nreceives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description.\nMATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as\nhealthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The\nsystem supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using\ncustom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the\nsystem can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of\nhardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy\nand security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be\neffectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital\nhealthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce\nModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise\nmodality conversion task from the user input.
