We consider a defense scenario in which one\nplayer (the Defender) seeks to infer and exploit the abstraction used by the\nother player (the Attacker). The interaction between the two players is modeled\nas a Bayesian game: the Defender selects a barrier configuration, i.e., a\nplacement of obstacles that can obstruct the Attacker's movement, based on its\nbelief about the Attacker's abstraction, while the Attacker chooses a\ntrajectory that may intentionally obfuscate its own abstraction of the\nenvironment to mislead the Defender. We show that purposeful abstraction\nconcealment naturally emerges from this formulation as a means of improving the\nAttacker's performance. To solve the game, we propose a bilinear programming\napproach that integrates Bayesian inference, strategic planning, and belief\nmanipulation. Simulations demonstrate that, by shaping the Defender's belief,\nthe Attacker can induce suboptimal Defender barrier placement, thereby gaining\na strategic advantage."}

This study proposes a novel MAPF\nframework for high-density environments (MAPF-HD). Several studies have\nexplored MAPF in similar settings using integer linear programming (ILP).\nHowever, ILP-based methods require substantial computation time to optimize all\nagent paths simultaneously.

However, urban road\nnetworks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate\nrepresentation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from\nneighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus\non a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents\nMSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that\nintegrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow\nheterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution\nto extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies\nscale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of\nroad networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,\nMSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple\nscales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,\nwhich are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road\nnetwork representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that\nMSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The\nperformance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more\nfrom incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in\ncomplex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the\nmost competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework\nfor developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights\ndistinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow\nheterogeneity of spatial interactions."}

Paper2Agent addresses this\nchallenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a\nknowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the\nassociated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify\nthe resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat\nagent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through\nnatural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We\ndemonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper\nagents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that\nleverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy\nand TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We\nvalidate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and\ncan correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into\ndynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for\nknowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI\nco-scientists."}

However,\nthey exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with\ngradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,\nthus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often\nneed continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired\naesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address\nthe limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that\npredefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time\nsteps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are\ninterpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids\nover-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic\nRelative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as\ntext-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in\nresponse to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the\nreliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model\nwith optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its\nhuman-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x."}

Orchestrator introduces a monitoring mechanism to track\nagent-environment dynamics, using active inference benchmarks to optimize\nsystem behavior. By tracking agent-to-agent and agent-to-environment\ninteraction, Orchestrator mitigates the effects of partial observability and\nenables agents to approximate global task solutions more efficiently.

HECATE is built\nusing the Entity-Component-System architectural pattern, leveraging\ndata-oriented design to implement multiagent systems. This approach involves\nengineering multiagent systems (MAS) from a distributed systems (DS)\nperspective, integrating agent concepts directly into the DS domain. This\napproach simplifies MAS development by (i) reducing the need for specialized\nagent knowledge and (ii) leveraging familiar DS patterns and standards to\nminimize the agent-specific knowledge required for engineering MAS. We present\nthe framework's architecture, core components, and implementation approach,\ndemonstrating how it supports different agent models."}
