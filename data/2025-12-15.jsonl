Existing approaches excel at optimizing efficiency and enforcing safety constraints but lack mechanisms to ensure equitable service, resulting in systematic starvation of vehicles on low-demand approaches. We propose a hierarchical framework combining multi-objective reinforcement learning for local intersection control with strategic routing for network-level coordination. Our approach introduces a Conflict Threat Vector that provides agents with explicit risk signals for proactive conflict avoidance, and a queue parity penalty that ensures equitable service across all traffic streams. Extensive experiments on a real-world network across different robot vehicle (RV) penetration rates demonstrate substantial improvements: up to 53% reductions in average wait time, up to 86% reductions in maximum starvation, and up to 86\\% reduction in conflict rate compared to baselines, while maintaining fuel efficiency. Our analysis reveals that strategic routing effectiveness scales with RV penetration, becoming increasingly valuable at higher autonomy levels. The results demonstrate that multi-objective optimization through well-curated reward functions paired with strategic RV routing yields significant benefits in fairness and safety metrics critical for equitable mixed-autonomy deployment."}

We focus on mixed-motive social dilemmas instantiated as a \\textit{Tragedy of the Commons} environment from the Melting Pot suite, where we systematically compare human groups and Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents, each evaluated with and without explicit communication. Cooperative resilience is assessed under a continuously disruptive condition induced by a persistent unsustainable consumption bot, together with intermittent environmental shocks implemented as stochastic removal of shared resources across scenarios. This experimental design establishes a benchmark for cooperative resilience across agent architectures and interaction modalities, constituting a key step toward systematically comparing humans and LLM-based agents. Using this framework, we find that human groups with communication achieve the highest cooperative resilience compared to all other groups. Communication also improves the resilience of LLM agents, but their performance remains below human levels. Motivated by the performance of humans, we further examine a long-horizon setting with harsher environmental conditions, where humans sustain the shared resource and maintain high resilience in diverse disruption scenarios. Together, these results suggest that human decision-making under adverse social conditions can inform the design of artificial agents that promote prosocial and resilient behaviors."}

The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL.

We model the OFEX combinatorial bundling problem as a multi-commodity one-to-one pickup-and-delivery selective traveling salesperson problem (m1-PDSTSP), which optimizes revenue-driven freight bundling under capacity, precedence, and route-length constraints. The key challenge is to couple combinatorial bundle selection with pickup-and-delivery routing under sub-second latency. We propose a learning--accelerated hybrid search pipeline that pairs a Transformer Neural Network-based constructive policy with an innovative Multi-Start Large Neighborhood Search (MSLNS) metaheuristic within a rolling-horizon scheme in which the platform repeatedly freezes the current marketplace into a static snapshot and solves it under a short time budget. This pairing leverages the low-latency, high-quality inference of the learning-based constructor alongside the robustness of improvement search; the multi-start design and plausible seeds help LNS to explore the solution space more efficiently. Across benchmarks, our method outperforms state-of-the-art neural combinatorial optimization and metaheuristic baselines in solution quality with comparable time, achieving an optimality gap of less than 2\\% in total revenue relative to the best available exact baseline method.

Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization."}

We introduce an agentic large language model (LLM)-based framework for automated MDP modeling and policy generation (A-LAMP), that automatically translates free-form natural language task descriptions into an MDP formulation and trained policy. The framework decomposes modeling, coding, and training into verifiable stages, ensuring semantic alignment throughout the pipeline. Across both classic control and custom RL domains, A-LAMP consistently achieves higher policy generation capability than a single state-of-the-art LLM model.

In addition, a case study also demonstrates that A-LAMP generates environments and policies that preserve the task's optimality, confirming its correctness and reliability."}

Consequently, these benchmarks cannot comprehensively cover all CAPTCHA types.

While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms. We apply PatternBoost transformer learning and reinforcement learning (PPO) to this problem for the first time, comparing them against ILP. ILP achieves provably optimal solutions up to 19 by 19 grids, while PatternBoost matches optimal performance up to 14 by 14 grids with 96% test loss reduction.

For nine globally limiting pests, weeds, and plant diseases, we assessed the factual accuracy, data consistency, and breadth of knowledge or data completeness of each LLM. Overall, DeepSeek consistently screened a 4.8-49.7-fold larger literature corpus and reported 1.6-2.4-fold more biological control agents or management solutions than ChatGPT. As a result, DeepSeek reported 21.6% higher efficacy estimates, exhibited greater laboratory-to-field data consistency, and showed more realistic effects of pest identity and management tactics.

This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies. Our work was awarded the Excellence Award in Open Science. Complete information can be found at https://curebench.ai/."}
