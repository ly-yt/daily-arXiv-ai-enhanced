We introduce a two predictor framework, that assumes that\nagents use one predictor for their future (self) behavior, and one for the\nbehavior of the other players. The main problem we are concerned with is\nunderstanding what are the best competitive ratios that can be achieved by\nemploying such predictors, under various assumptions on predictor quality.\n  As an illustration of our framework, we introduce and analyze a multiagent\nversion of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by\npooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price\nis not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a\nunit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no\nextra cost.\n  In the particular case of perfect other predictions the algorithm that\nfollows the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions of\nagent's future behavior; we give an algorithm with better robustness properties\nand benchmark it."}

However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in\nartificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static\nrepresentations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of\nthe efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through\ninteraction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we\nprovide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in\ncognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call\nfor a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI.\nConcretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully\ndesigned games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the\nunderlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games.

Making these decisions reliant on human\njudgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number\nof scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload\nneeded to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human\njudgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will\ndesign the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to\nexplore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the\ntesting environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to\nselect from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select\nthe most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed\naccordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are\nsufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is\nsolved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how\nto weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,\nhow to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with\ndecision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The\nmulti-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby\nproblems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights\nduring aggregation.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24.

Supplementary material included at end of article", "summary": "The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)\nnecessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to\nevaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the\nassumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their\nstochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that\ntraditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this\nmismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper\nproffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based\nartificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative\nintegrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,\ncorrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral\nimagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term \"SMA-LLS\" (Simulating\nMoral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater\nalignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We\nillustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous\npublic bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally\nsalient contexts."}

Developing\nefficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism\npresents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more\nstraightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and\ncomputationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and\nfuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum\nT-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order\npatterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination,\nsoundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp\ncounterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the\nhighest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable."}

The most common is the use of automated\nbenchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different\ntopics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests\nthat for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more\ncomplex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived\nquality of the responses that justifies their use."}

But how close\nare they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can\ntackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific\nunderstanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn\naway from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on\nreal-life research problems.\n  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph\ntheory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of\nfrontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of\nreasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of\ncommercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems,\nsuch as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is\ngenerated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO)\nlogic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale;\nideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately\nrelated to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central\nconjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As\nsuch, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known\nresults, could carry profound theoretical implications.\n  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on\nFormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts\nand explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from\nexpert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we\nadditionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from\nthe same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive\nevaluation framework."}

We introduce a two predictor framework, that assumes that\nagents use one predictor for their future (self) behavior, and one for the\nbehavior of the other players. The main problem we are concerned with is\nunderstanding what are the best competitive ratios that can be achieved by\nemploying such predictors, under various assumptions on predictor quality.\n  As an illustration of our framework, we introduce and analyze a multiagent\nversion of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by\npooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price\nis not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a\nunit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no\nextra cost.\n  In the particular case of perfect other predictions the algorithm that\nfollows the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions of\nagent's future behavior; we give an algorithm with better robustness properties\nand benchmark it."}
