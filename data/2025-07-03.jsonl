Continuous\nformation control was assumed to be achieved through fuel-free actuation, such\nas satellite magnetic field interaction and differential aerodynamic forces,\nthereby maintaining long-term formation stability without thruster usage. A\nmajor challenge for such actuation systems is the potential loss of control\ncapability due to increasing inter-satellite distances resulting from unstable\norbital dynamics, particularly for autonomous satellite swarms.

Departing from the\nseminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic\nprograms, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We\nconsider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,\nconstraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be\nmandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The\nprinciple of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is\nconstructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of\ncircular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the\nformalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world\nviews. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of\nwell-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.\nFourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS\nprinciples. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline\nto intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze\nthe computational complexity."}
