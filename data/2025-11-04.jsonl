Despite sophisticated reward learning,\nDMARL-RSA achieves only -24.20 +/- 0.09 average reward, compared to MAPPO with\ncentralized training at 1.92 +/- 0.87--a 26.12-point gap. DMARL-RSA performs\nsimilarly to simple independent learning (IPPO: -23.19 +/- 0.96), indicating\nthat advanced reward shaping cannot overcome fundamental decentralized\ncoordination limitations.

Recent work proposes integrating\nverifiers that validate LLM output or actions, such as self-reflection, debate,\nor LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms. Yet, verifying every step introduces significant\nlatency and cost overheads.\n  In this work, we seek to answer three key questions: which nodes in a\nworkflow are most error-prone and thus deserve costly verification, how to\nselect the most appropriate verifier for each node, and how to use verification\nwith minimal impact to latency? Our solution, Sherlock, addresses these using\ncounterfactual analysis on agentic workflows to identify error-prone nodes and\nselectively attaching cost-optimal verifiers only where necessary. At runtime,\nSherlock speculatively executes downstream tasks to reduce latency overhead,\nwhile verification runs in the background. If verification fails, execution is\nrolled back to the last verified output. Compared to the non-verifying\nbaseline, Sherlock delivers an 18.3% accuracy gain on average across\nbenchmarks.

Although these\nadaptations often improve performance on specialized downstream tasks, recent\nevidence indicates that they can also degrade a model's safety or fairness.\nSince different fine-tuning techniques may exert distinct effects on these\ncritical dimensions, this study undertakes a systematic assessment of their\ntrade-offs. Four widely used Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods, LoRA,\nIA3, Prompt-Tuning, and P-Tuning, are applied to four instruction-tuned model\nfamilies (Meta-Llama-3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B). In total, 235\nfine-tuned variants are evaluated across eleven safety hazard categories and\nnine demographic fairness dimensions. The results show that adapter-based\napproaches (LoRA, IA3) tend to improve safety scores and are the least\ndisruptive to fairness, retaining higher accuracy and lower bias scores. In\ncontrast, prompt-based methods (Prompt-Tuning and P-Tuning) generally reduce\nsafety and cause larger fairness regressions, with decreased accuracy and\nincreased bias. Alignment shifts are strongly moderated by base model type:\nLLaMA remains stable, Qwen records modest gains, Gemma experiences the steepest\nsafety decline, and Mistral, which is released without an internal moderation\nlayer, displays the greatest variance. Improvements in safety do not\nnecessarily translate into improvements in fairness, and no single\nconfiguration optimizes all fairness metrics simultaneously, indicating an\ninherent trade-off between these objectives.

During the pandemic, we have observed a spike in\ncases related to mental health, such as anxiety, stress, and depression.\nDepression significantly influences most diseases worldwide, making it\ndifficult to detect mental health conditions in people due to unawareness and\nunwillingness to consult a doctor. However, nowadays, people extensively use\nonline social media platforms to express their emotions and thoughts. Hence,\nsocial media platforms are now becoming a large data source that can be\nutilized for detecting depression and mental illness. However, existing\napproaches often overlook data sparsity in tweets and the multimodal aspects of\nsocial media. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework that\ncombines textual, user-specific, and image analysis to detect depression among\nsocial media users. To provide enough context about the user's emotional state,\nwe propose (i) an extrinsic feature by harnessing the URLs present in tweets\nand (ii) extracting textual content present in images posted in tweets.

C-DAGs\ndefine an equivalence class of acyclic causal graphs that agree on\ncluster-level relationships, enabling causal reasoning at a higher level of\nabstraction. However, when the chosen clustering induces cycles in the\nresulting C-DAG, the partition is deemed inadmissible under conventional C-DAG\nsemantics. In this work, we extend the C-DAG framework to support arbitrary\nvariable clusterings by relaxing the partition admissibility constraint,\nthereby allowing cyclic C-DAG representations. We extend the notions of\nd-separation and causal calculus to this setting, significantly broadening the\nscope of causal reasoning across clusters and enabling the application of\nC-DAGs in previously intractable scenarios. Our calculus is both sound and\natomically complete with respect to the do-calculus: all valid interventional\nqueries at the cluster level can be derived using our rules, each corresponding\nto a primitive do-calculus step."}

Despite advancements in algorithm design, existing\napproaches suffer from two critical limitations: insufficient learning of\nnoise-contaminated unimodal data, leading to corrupted cross-modal\ninteractions, and inadequate fusion of multimodal representations, resulting in\ndiscarding discriminative unimodal information while retaining multimodal\nredundant information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nDouble Information Bottleneck (DIB) strategy to obtain a powerful, unified\ncompact multimodal representation. Implemented within the framework of low-rank\nRenyi's entropy functional, DIB offers enhanced robustness against diverse\nnoise sources and computational tractability for high-dimensional data, as\ncompared to the conventional Shannon entropy-based methods. The DIB comprises\ntwo key modules: 1) learning a sufficient and compressed representation of\nindividual unimodal data by maximizing the task-relevant information and\ndiscarding the superfluous information, and 2) ensuring the discriminative\nability of multimodal representation through a novel attention bottleneck\nfusion mechanism. Consequently, DIB yields a multimodal representation that\neffectively filters out noisy information from unimodal data while capturing\ninter-modal complementarity. Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,\nCH-SIMS, and MVSA-Single validate the effectiveness of our method. The model\nachieves 47.4% accuracy under the Acc-7 metric on CMU-MOSI and 81.63% F1-score\non CH-SIMS, outperforming the second-best baseline by 1.19%.

This paper introduces TPS-Bench to benchmark the ability of\nLLM agents in solving such problems that demand Tool Planning and Scheduling.\nTPS-Bench collects 200 compounding tasks of two difficulty levels, based on a\ntool repository containing hundreds of model context protocol (MCP) tools.
