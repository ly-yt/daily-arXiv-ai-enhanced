Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a\ncollection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous\" causal mechanism\nthat assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous\nvariables.

However, it has not been fully\nstudied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward\nunderstanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger\nwaiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth\ndata-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on\npassenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we\npropose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to\npredict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We\nfurther perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each\nfactor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including\nover 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good\nperformance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high\nexplainability."}

Continuous Variable Current Modulation\n(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,\nit can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as\nsubtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in\nmonitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,\nstruggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is\nessential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue\nloss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance\nframework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.\nValidated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method\nis ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving\n99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through\nconformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence\nwith consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the\napproach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,\nenhancing operational reliability."}

Auditing Membership Leakage in Semi-Black-box RAG Controlling", "comment": null, "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual\nunderstanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge\nsources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,\nrendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute\ngenerated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus\nundermining privacy leakage accountability\n  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership\nAudit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content\nin a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the\nenvironmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an\nattribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which\nrobustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through\nlarge-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,\nSMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs\ninto textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the\ntext modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on\nimage retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of\nmembership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the\ncontent is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data\nprovenance in complex generative systems."}

As\ntheir commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA\nsystems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital\ninteractions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research\ncommunity needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,\nlimitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive\nopen-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework\nconsists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human\ncomputer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use\ntask dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;\n(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs\nwith reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance\ngains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong\nperformance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an\naverage success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA\n(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across\ndomains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation.

Current large\nlanguage model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to\nlimitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying\nrestricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the\ncontinuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose\nBrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented\nplanner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search\nstrategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,\ntargeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence.
