However, most\npipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and\nrisking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an\nRM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining\n$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient\nexploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that\ncombines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the\noffline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate\nper-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router\nperforms per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with\noffline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors\nwith online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive\nexperiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and\nreasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently\noutperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods."}

At the\nsame time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally\nblack-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly\nlimiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim\nto overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision\nprocess. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and\nscientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their\nassumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different\nconceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an\nexplanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or\nrelative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical\ndebate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into\ndifferent XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the\nvalidity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We\ninvestigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability\nmethods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make\nabout the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about\nthose explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to\nan XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying\nassumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring\nthe underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a\ngiven application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI\nmethods for different domains of application."}

While counterfactual explanations, which describe what\ncould have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful\ntool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them\nin these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization\nand implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It\nis implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for\nsmart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated\ncounterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that\nuser preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their\nlinguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals\nare preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to\nresolve a problem.

Raven's Progressive Matrices\n(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by\nrequiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based\nand language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains\nunclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or\nreliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization\ncapacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by\ndeliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both\nsequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as\nCoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN\n(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate\nstrong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when\nfaced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level\naccuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in\ncurrent approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning\nmechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for\narchitectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract\nreasoning."}

While there are some theoretical and primary\nempirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped\ntransformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models\ntypically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue\nthat diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete\nspace. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger\nexpressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By\ncombining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent\nspace, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of\nexplicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced\ntraining/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical\nperformance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks."}
