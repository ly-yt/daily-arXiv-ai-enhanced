Most MAPF planners assume that each\nagent reaches a specific location at a specific timestep, but this is\ninfeasible to directly follow on real systems where delays often occur. To\naddress collisions caused by agents deviating due to delays, the Temporal Plan\nGraph (TPG) was proposed, which converts a MAPF time dependent solution into a\ntime independent set of inter-agent dependencies. Recently, a Bidirectional TPG\n(BTPG) was proposed which relaxed some dependencies into ``bidirectional pairs\"\nand improved efficiency of agents executing their MAPF solution with delays.\nOur work improves upon this prior work by designing an algorithm, BPTG-max,\nthat finds more bidirectional pairs. Our main theoretical contribution is in\ndesigning the BTPG-max algorithm is locally optimal, i.e. which constructs a\nBTPG where no additional bidirectional pairs can be added. We also show how in\npractice BTPG-max leads to BTPGs with significantly more bidirectional edges,\nsuperior anytime behavior, and improves robustness to delays."}

This\npaper introduces a novel path-planning problem, congestion mitigation path\nplanning (CMPP), which embeds congestion directly into the cost function,\ndefined by the usage of incoming edges along agents' paths. CMPP assigns a\nflow-based multiplicative penalty to each vertex of a sparse graph, which grows\nsteeply where frequently-traversed paths intersect, capturing the intuition\nthat congestion intensifies where many agents enter the same area from\ndifferent directions. Minimizing the total cost yields a set of coarse-level,\ntime-independent routes that autonomous agents can follow while applying their\nown local collision avoidance. We formulate the problem and develop two\nsolvers: (i) an exact mixed-integer nonlinear programming solver for small\ninstances, and (ii) a scalable two-layer search algorithm, A-CMTS, which\nquickly finds suboptimal solutions for large-scale instances and iteratively\nrefines them toward the optimum. Empirical studies show that augmenting\nstate-of-the-art collision-avoidance planners with CMPP significantly reduces\nlocal congestion and enhances system throughput in both discrete- and\ncontinuous-space scenarios. These results indicate that CMPP improves the\nperformance of multi-agent systems in real-world applications such as logistics\nand autonomous-vehicle operations."}

Standard\napproaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the\navailability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by\nleveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep\nLearning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In\nrecent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling\ninput data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph\nNeural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,\noffer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex\nmulti-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for\nmore expressive and semantically rich encodings.\n  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural\nNetwork model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will\nreturn the full set of attributes missing from those events.

Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or\nmisinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid\ncultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we\npropose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection\ngating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles\nfour complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a\nmodality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse\ninterpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents\nrefine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and\nefficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate\nsignificantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate\nbaselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing\nreliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts."}

As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on\nextensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the\nbottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that\ncan develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical\nconstraints."}

Recent\napproaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore\ncognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track\nprogress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore\nhuman-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically\ngrounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free\nGeneral Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly\nknowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer\ninteraction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners\nover a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis\nreveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our\nspecially designed \"trap questions\" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's\nshallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct\nlearners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'\nself-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing\nsurprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)\nCritically, the default profile of base LLM is a \"diligent but brittle Surface\nLearner\"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,\ngeneralizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that\nLearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings\nabout LLMs' behavior."}
