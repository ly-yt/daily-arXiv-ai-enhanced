While\neffective under strong planner models, this design suffers from two critical\nlimitations: (1) strong dependency on the planner's capability, which leads to\ndegraded performance when a smaller LLM powers the planner; and (2) limited\ninter-agent communication, where collaboration relies on costly prompt\nconcatenation and context injection, introducing redundancy and information\nloss. To address these challenges, we propose Anemoi, a semi-centralized MAS\nbuilt on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication MCP server from Coral Protocol.\nUnlike traditional designs, Anemoi enables structured and direct inter-agent\ncollaboration, allowing all agents to monitor progress, assess results,\nidentify bottlenecks, and propose refinements in real time. This paradigm\nreduces reliance on a single planner, supports adaptive plan updates, and\nminimizes redundant context passing, resulting in more scalable and\ncost-efficient execution. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Anemoi achieved\n52.73\\% accuracy with a small LLM (GPT-4.1-mini) as the planner, surpassing the\nstrongest open-source baseline OWL (43.63\\%) by +9.09\\% under identical LLM\nsettings.

However, these approaches primarily focus on promoting cooperation by\nmanaging the trade-off between individual and collective returns, without\nexplicitly addressing fairness with respect to the agents' task-specific\nrewards. In this paper, we propose an adaptive conflict-aware gradient\nadjustment method that promotes cooperation while ensuring fairness in\nindividual rewards. The proposed method dynamically balances policy gradients\nderived from individual and collective objectives in situations where the two\nobjectives are in conflict. By explicitly resolving such conflicts, our method\nimproves collective performance while preserving fairness across agents.

In this work, we conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the rationales for ICD coding\nthrough two key lenses: faithfulness that evaluates how well explanations\nreflect the model's actual reasoning and plausibility that measures how\nconsistent the explanations are with human expert judgment. To facilitate the\nevaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset,\noffering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with\ncurrent clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of\nrationales of ICD coding.

Prior works typically quantify sycophancy by\nmeasuring shifts in behavior or impacts on accuracy, but neither metric\ncharacterizes shifts in rationality, and accuracy measures can only be used in\nscenarios with a known ground truth. In this work, we utilize a Bayesian\nframework to quantify sycophancy as deviations from rational behavior when\npresented with user perspectives, thus distinguishing between rational and\nirrational updates based on the introduction of user perspectives. In\ncomparison to other methods, this approach allows us to characterize excessive\nbehavioral shifts, even for tasks that involve inherent uncertainty or do not\nhave a ground truth. We study sycophancy for 3 different tasks, a combination\nof open-source and closed LLMs, and two different methods for probing\nsycophancy.

Spacer\nattempts to achieve this via 'deliberate decontextualization,' an approach that\ndisassembles information into atomic units - keywords - and draws creativity\nfrom unexplored connections between them. Spacer consists of (i) Nuri, an\ninspiration engine that builds keyword sets, and (ii) the Manifesting Pipeline\nthat refines these sets into elaborate scientific statements. Nuri extracts\nnovel, high-potential keyword sets from a keyword graph built with 180,000\nacademic publications in biological fields. The Manifesting Pipeline finds\nlinks between keywords, analyzes their logical structure, validates their\nplausibility, and ultimately drafts original scientific concepts. According to\nour experiments, the evaluation metric of Nuri accurately classifies\nhigh-impact publications with an AUROC score of 0.737. Our Manifesting Pipeline\nalso successfully reconstructs core concepts from the latest top-journal\narticles solely from their keyword sets. An LLM-based scoring system estimates\nthat this reconstruction was sound for over 85% of the cases. Finally, our\nembedding space analysis shows that outputs from Spacer are significantly more\nsimilar to leading publications compared with those from SOTA LLMs."}

To move beyond this\nlimitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic\nframework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents\nbased on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that\nrequire explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural\nlanguage intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and\norchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a\nself-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time\nscales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to\nnetwork-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is\nthe AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent\ninteractions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control\nalgorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of\nfunctions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We\ndemonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing\nuser demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents.

We compare their\nrepresentations of images to those of the human brain recorded with both fMRI\nand MEG, providing high resolution in spatial and temporal analyses. We assess\nthe brain-model similarity with three complementary metrics focusing on overall\nrepresentational similarity, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics.\nWe show that all three factors - model size, training amount, and image type -\nindependently and interactively impact each of these brain similarity metrics.\nIn particular, the largest DINOv3 models trained with the most human-centric\nimages reach the highest brain-similarity. This emergence of brain-like\nrepresentations in AI models follows a specific chronology during training:\nmodels first align with the early representations of the sensory cortices, and\nonly align with the late and prefrontal representations of the brain with\nconsiderably more training. Finally, this developmental trajectory is indexed\nby both structural and functional properties of the human cortex: the\nrepresentations that are acquired last by the models specifically align with\nthe cortical areas with the largest developmental expansion, thickness, least\nmyelination, and slowest timescales.
