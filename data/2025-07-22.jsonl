Submitted as an arXiv preprint. All code and\n  experiment details included in appendix", "summary": "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research traditionally focuses on\nalgorithms that optimize for specific goals under deterministic rules. Yet,\nhuman-like intelligence exhibits adaptive spontaneity - an ability to make\nunexpected choices or free decisions not strictly dictated by past data or\nimmediate reward. This trait, often dubbed \"free will\" in a loose sense, might\nbe crucial for creativity, robust adaptation, and avoiding ruts in\nproblem-solving. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free\nWill Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI\nagents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their\ndecision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive\nstate as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses\nprobabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a\nquantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement. By incorporating mechanisms\nanalogous to quantum fields, along with intrinsic motivation terms, we aim to\nimprove an agent's ability to explore novel strategies and adapt to unforeseen\nchanges. Experiments in a non-stationary multi-armed bandit environment\ndemonstrate that agents using this framework achieve higher rewards and policy\ndiversity compared to baseline methods."}

The emergence of large language\nmodel (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing\nLLM-based drama generation methods often result in AI agents that lack\ninitiative and cannot interact with the physical environment. Furthermore,\nthese methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These\nlimitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time\nperformance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent\nframework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple\ntopic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent\nimprovisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given\nan autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based\non their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to\nconversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of\nscene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon.\nThe change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know\nand care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the\nquality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three\nprimary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and\ninteraction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can\ncreate expressive and coherent theatrical experiences. Our code, dataset and\nmodels are available at https://github.com/HAMLET-2025/HAMLET."}

Traditionally, developers estimate story points\ncollaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques.

Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with\nenough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,\nstate-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate\npredictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The\ngoal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a\ncomparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story\npoint prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to\nevery backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate\nwhich item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine\nlearning model is trained to predict the story point estimates.

However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that\nproviding individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated\nactivity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee\nother team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or\nphysician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework\nfor effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence\nExplorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent\nsystem that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from\nindividualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an\noverseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The\nPCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision.\nThis effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen\nasynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical\nExamination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we\ncompared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across\n60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality\nintake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the\noverseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions.\nPCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP\nconsultations in prior work.

The intricate interactions among\nintelligent agents make abnormal emergence analysis challenging, as traditional\ncausal methods focus on individual trajectories.
