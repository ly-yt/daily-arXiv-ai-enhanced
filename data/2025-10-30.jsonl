Traditional agent-based or deep\nlearning models can reproduce statistical patterns of movement but fail to\ncapture the semantic coherence and causal logic of human behavior. Large\nlanguage models (LLMs) show potential, but struggle to balance creative\nreasoning with strict structural compliance. This study proposes a Hierarchical\nLLM-Agent Framework, termed Narrative-to-Action, that integrates high-level\nnarrative reasoning, mid-level reflective planning, and low-level behavioral\nexecution within a unified cognitive hierarchy. At the macro level, one agent\nis employed as a \"creative writer\" to produce diary-style narratives rich in\nmotivation and context, then uses another agent as a \"structural parser\" to\nconvert narratives into machine-readable plans. A dynamic execution module\nfurther grounds agents in geographic environments and enables adaptive\nbehavioral adjustments guided by a novel occupation-aware metric, Mobility\nEntropy by Occupation (MEO), which captures heterogeneous schedule flexibility\nacross different occupational personalities. At the micro level, the agent\nexecutes concrete actions-selecting locations, transportation modes, and time\nintervals-through interaction with an environmental simulation. By embedding\nthis multi-layer cognitive process, the framework produces not only synthetic\ntrajectories that align closely with real-world patterns but also interpretable\nrepresentations of human decision logic. This research advances synthetic\nmobility generation from a data-driven paradigm to a cognition-driven\nsimulation, providing a scalable pathway for understanding, predicting, and\nsynthesizing complex urban mobility behaviors through hierarchical LLM agents."}

This technical report bridges this gap by developing a\ncomputational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic\ncoopetition with dynamic trust evolution. We introduce trust as a two-layer\nsystem with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation\ntracking violation history. Trust evolves through asymmetric updating where\ncooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply, creating\nhysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery.

As a result, they provide no principled or efficient channel\nfor transmitting fine-grained visual information. We introduce Seeing Eye, a\nmodular framework that unlocks multimodal reasoning in text-only LLMs through\nan agent-based small VLM translator. This translator acts as a perception\nagent: it can invoke specialized tools (e.g., OCR and crop) and iteratively\ndistill multimodal inputs into structured intermediate representations (SIRs)\ntailored to the question.

Existing\nautomatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,\noften suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor\nadaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA\n(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that\nautonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex\nindustrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding\ncapabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided\nself-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea\nAgents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,\nand implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and\nupdates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable\ncontinual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution\nalgorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to\nbalance exploration and exploitation across the idea space.

By embedding\nthis multi-layer cognitive process, the framework produces not only synthetic\ntrajectories that align closely with real-world patterns but also interpretable\nrepresentations of human decision logic. This research advances synthetic\nmobility generation from a data-driven paradigm to a cognition-driven\nsimulation, providing a scalable pathway for understanding, predicting, and\nsynthesizing complex urban mobility behaviors through hierarchical LLM agents."}

We present the Multi-Agent System\nProcess Reward Model (MASPRM). It assigns per-action, per-agent values to\npartial inter-agent transcripts and acts as an inference-time controller.\nMASPRM is trained from multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts\nwithout requiring step-level human annotations, by propagating returns to local\ntargets. At inference, MASPRM guides step-level beam search and MCTS, focusing\ncomputation on promising branches and pruning early. On GSM8K and MATH,\nMASPRM-guided decoding with an outcome reward model (ORM) applied to the final\nanswer, improves exact match (EM) over a single straight-through MAS pass by\n$+30.7$ and $+22.9$ points, respectively. A MASPRM trained on GSM8K transfers\nzero-shot to MATH without retraining, adding $8.4$ EM points at the same\nbudget. MASPRM is a plug-in value model that estimates per-agent progress and\ncomplements verifier-style decoders, enabling more reliable, compute-aware\nmulti-agent reasoning.

It builds on the frameworks established in\n  that prior work and also adapts and extends material on trustworthiness first\n  presented in the doctoral dissertation 'Modeling Strategic Coopetition'\n  (Pant, 2021, University of Toronto)", "summary": "Requirements engineering increasingly occurs in multi-stakeholder\nenvironments where organizations simultaneously cooperate and compete, creating\ncoopetitive relationships in which trust evolves dynamically based on observed\nbehavior over repeated interactions. While conceptual modeling languages like\ni* represent trust relationships qualitatively, they lack computational\nmechanisms for analyzing how trust changes with behavioral evidence.\nConversely, computational trust models from multi-agent systems provide\nalgorithmic updating but lack grounding in requirements engineering contexts\nand conceptual models. This technical report bridges this gap by developing a\ncomputational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic\ncoopetition with dynamic trust evolution. We introduce trust as a two-layer\nsystem with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation\ntracking violation history. Trust evolves through asymmetric updating where\ncooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply, creating\nhysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery. We\ndevelop a structured translation framework enabling requirements engineers to\ninstantiate computational trust models from i* dependency networks and\norganizational contexts. Comprehensive experimental validation across 78,125\nparameter configurations establishes robust emergence of negativity bias,\nhysteresis effects, and cumulative damage amplification. Empirical validation\nusing the Renault-Nissan Alliance case study (1999-2025) achieves 49 out of 60\nvalidation points (81.7%), successfully reproducing documented trust evolution\nacross five distinct relationship phases including crisis and recovery periods.\nThis technical report builds upon its foundational companion work in\narXiv:2510.18802."}
