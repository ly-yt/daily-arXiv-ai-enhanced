We introduce TrustTrack, a\nprotocol that embeds structural guarantees -- verifiable identity, policy\ncommitments, and tamper-resistant behavioral logs -- directly into agent\ninfrastructure. This enables a new systems paradigm: trust-native autonomy. By\ntreating compliance as a design constraint rather than post-hoc oversight,\nTrustTrack reframes how intelligent agents operate across organizations and\njurisdictions. We present the protocol design, system requirements, and use\ncases in regulated domains such as pharmaceutical R&D, legal automation, and\nAI-native collaboration. We argue that the Cloud -> AI -> Agent -> Trust\ntransition represents the next architectural layer for autonomous systems."}

Prior research in single-agent\nsystems has shown that successor features can provide a ``jump start\" for\nagents when facing new tasks with varying reward structures. However, knowledge\ntransfer in games typically relies on value and equilibrium transfers, which\nheavily depends on the similarity between tasks. This reliance can lead to\nfailures when the tasks differ significantly. To address this issue, this paper\npresents an application of successor features to games and presents a novel\nalgorithm called Game Generalized Policy Improvement (GGPI), designed to\naddress Markov games in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The proposed\nalgorithm enables the transfer of learning values and policies across games. An\nupper bound of the errors for transfer is derived as a function the similarity\nof the task. Through experiments with a turn-based pursuer-evader game, we\ndemonstrate that the GGPI algorithm can generate high-reward interactions and\none-shot policy transfer. When further tested in a wider set of initial\nconditions, the GGPI algorithm achieves higher success rates with improved path\nefficiency compared to those of the baseline algorithms."}

This richer\nconception of systematicity has been obscured by the long shadow of the\n\"systematicity challenge\" to connectionism, according to which network\narchitectures are fundamentally at odds with what Fodor and colleagues termed\n\"the systematicity of thought.\" I offer a conceptual framework for thinking\nabout \"the systematicity of thought\" that distinguishes four senses of the\nphrase. I use these distinctions to defuse the perceived tension between\nsystematicity and connectionism and show that the conception of systematicity\nthat historically shaped our sense of what makes thought rational,\nauthoritative, and scientific is more demanding than the Fodorian notion. To\ndetermine whether we have reason to hold AI models to this ideal of\nsystematicity, I then argue, we must look to the rationales for systematization\nand explore to what extent they transfer to AI models. I identify five such\nrationales and apply them to AI.

We further examine how psychology theories/frameworks are\noperationalized and interpreted, identify common types of misapplication, and\noffer guidance for more effective incorporation. Our work provides a\ncomprehensive map of interdisciplinary engagement between AI and psychology,\nthereby facilitating deeper collaboration and advancing AI systems."}

This\nwork introduces a novel paradigm which effectively optimizes complex SAT\nsolvers via Large Language Models (LLMs), and a tool called AutoModSAT is\ndeveloped. Three fundamental challenges are addressed in order to achieve\nsuperior performance: (1) LLM-friendly solver: Systematic guidelines are\nproposed for developing a modularized solver to meet LLMs' compatibility,\nemphasizing code simplification, information share and bug reduction; (2)\nAutomatic prompt optimization: An unsupervised automatic prompt optimization\nmethod is introduced to advance the diversity of LLMs' output; (3) Efficient\nsearch strategy: We design a presearch strategy and an EA evolutionary\nalgorithm for the final efficient and effective discovery of heuristics.\nExtensive experiments across a wide range of datasets demonstrate that\nAutoModSAT achieves 50% performance improvement over the baseline solver and\nachieves 30% superiority against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) solvers. Moreover,\nAutoModSAT attains a 20% speedup on average compared to parameter-tuned\nalternatives of the SOTA solvers, showcasing the enhanced capability in\nhandling complex problem instances. This work bridges the gap between AI-driven\nheuristics discovery and mission-critical system optimization, and provides\nboth methodological advancements and empirically validated results for\nnext-generation complex solver development."}

Vision paper and protocol blueprint. No prior\n  submission or publication", "summary": "As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) proliferate in\nhigh-stakes domains -- from pharmaceuticals to legal workflows -- the challenge\nis no longer just intelligence, but verifiability. We introduce TrustTrack, a\nprotocol that embeds structural guarantees -- verifiable identity, policy\ncommitments, and tamper-resistant behavioral logs -- directly into agent\ninfrastructure. This enables a new systems paradigm: trust-native autonomy. By\ntreating compliance as a design constraint rather than post-hoc oversight,\nTrustTrack reframes how intelligent agents operate across organizations and\njurisdictions. We present the protocol design, system requirements, and use\ncases in regulated domains such as pharmaceutical R&D, legal automation, and\nAI-native collaboration. We argue that the Cloud -> AI -> Agent -> Trust\ntransition represents the next architectural layer for autonomous systems."}

We investigate whether LLM-based\nmulti-agent simulations can reproduce core human social dynamics observed in\nonline forums. We evaluate conformity dynamics, group polarization, and\nfragmentation across different model scales and reasoning capabilities using a\nstructured simulation framework. Our findings indicate that smaller models\nexhibit higher conformity rates, whereas models optimized for reasoning are\nmore resistant to social influence."}
