However, existing LLM-based approaches generally fail to assess\nstudents' abilities, design learning plans, provide personalized material\naligned with individual learning goals, and enable interactive learning.\nCurrent work mostly uses single LLM agents, which limits their ability to\nunderstand complex code repositories and schedule step-by-step tutoring. Recent\nresearch has shown that multi-agent LLMs can collaborate to solve complicated\nproblems in various domains like software engineering, but their potential in\nthe field of education remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CodeEdu,\nan innovative multi-agent collaborative platform that combines LLMs with tool\nuse to provide proactive and personalized education in coding. Unlike static\npipelines, CodeEdu dynamically allocates agents and tasks to meet student\nneeds. Various agents in CodeEdu undertake certain functions specifically,\nincluding task planning, personalized material generation, real-time QA,\nstep-by-step tutoring, code execution, debugging, and learning report\ngeneration, facilitated with extensive external tools to improve task\nefficiency.

However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and\nrequires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements\nin Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this\nanalysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities\nfor interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in\nproviding detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for\nintegrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted\nanalysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study,\nseveral LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the\nquality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different\nNDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions.\nEach LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed\ndescriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and\ndemonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine\nmodels provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of\ntopics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models\nare summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of\nthe bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more\neffective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to\nsignificantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an\ninnovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and\nsummarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and\nenhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments."}

While recent advances in LLMs show\npromise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low\nsuccess rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:\ntrained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250\nCUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the\nmodel also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,\nachieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,\nx14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.\nBeyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable\nproperties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns\nto combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers\nfundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious\nperformance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that\nharm performance.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can\ntransform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer\nthrough speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain\nknowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning\nabilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated\noptimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU\nefficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources."}
