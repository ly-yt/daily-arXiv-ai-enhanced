However, the validity of LLMs as\nproxies for human behavior in LSCM simulations is unknown. This study evaluates\nLLM equivalence of human behavior through a controlled experiment examining\ndyadic customer-worker engagements in food delivery scenarios. I test six\nstate-of-the-art LLMs against 957 human participants (477 dyads) using a\nmoderated mediation design. This study reveals a need to validate GABMs on two\nlevels: (1) human equivalence testing, and (2) decision process validation.\nResults reveal GABMs can effectively simulate human behaviors in LSCM; however,\nan equivalence-versus-process paradox emerges. While a series of Two One-Sided\nTests (TOST) for equivalence reveals some LLMs demonstrate surface-level\nequivalence to humans, structural equation modeling (SEM) reveals artificial\ndecision processes not present in human participants for some LLMs. These\nfindings show GABMs as a potentially viable methodological instrument in LSCM\nwith proper validation checks. The dual-validation framework also provides LSCM\nresearchers with a guide to rigorous GABM development. For practitioners, this\nstudy offers evidence-based assessment for LLM selection for operational tasks."}

We\nfurther show that periodic orbits of the dynamical system, when they arise,\ncorrespond to periodic Nash equilibria, and we provide numerical evidence of\nconvergence to such cycles.

For instance, humans may hold unrealistic\nexpectations about future outcomes. As the evolutionary roots of such biases\nremain unclear, we investigate here how reasoning abilities and cognitive\nbiases co-evolve using Evolutionary Game Theory. In our model, individuals in a\npopulation deploy a variety of unbiased and biased level-k reasoning strategies\nto anticipate others' behaviour in sequential interactions, represented by the\nIncremental Centipede Game. Positively biased reasoning strategies have a\nsystematic inference bias towards higher but uncertain rewards, while\nnegatively biased strategies reflect the opposite tendency. We find that\nselection consistently favours positively biased reasoning, with rational\nbehaviour even going extinct. This bias co-evolves with bounded rationality, as\nthe reasoning depth remains limited in the population. Interestingly,\npositively biased agents may co-exist with non-reasoning agents, thus pointing\nto a novel equilibrium. Longer games further promote positively biased\nreasoning, as they can lead to higher future rewards. The biased reasoning\nstrategies proposed in this model may reflect cognitive phenomena like wishful\nthinking and defensive pessimism. This work therefore supports the claim that\ncertain cognitive biases, despite deviating from rational judgment, constitute\nan adaptive feature to better cope with social dilemmas."}

If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively\nevades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI\nsafety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human\nintervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI\nwith extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee\nsecurity. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework\nthat shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced\nstructural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are\ncomputationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined\nthreat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework\nis composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,\nand general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a\ngovernable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection\nagainst compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules\nand the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable\ntechnical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line\ndefined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,\ntamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack\nvectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security\nproperties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a\nprototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios."}

In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving\nrepresentative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,\nincorporating a \"rewriting-resolution-review-revision\" logical chain via three\nreasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,\nrespectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The\nConsultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link\nproblems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem\ndescriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible\nfor generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem\nresolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for\nself-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code\nruntime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable\ncode provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive\nevaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in\nsolving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis\nproblems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly\nimproves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of\nnon-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for\nautonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review\nmechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN\nsolutions) rate of the latest reasoning models.

Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations\ncharacterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and\nvarying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and\nconvergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional\ntimetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key\ninnovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by\naugmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station\nID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,\nvelocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to\ncapture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs\ninto a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function\naligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway\ndeviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule\nadherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves\nmore stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,\n-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that\nsingle-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and\nschedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,\nreal-world contexts.

While a series of Two One-Sided\nTests (TOST) for equivalence reveals some LLMs demonstrate surface-level\nequivalence to humans, structural equation modeling (SEM) reveals artificial\ndecision processes not present in human participants for some LLMs. These\nfindings show GABMs as a potentially viable methodological instrument in LSCM\nwith proper validation checks.
