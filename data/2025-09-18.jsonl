Agent-based models (ABMs) are\nwell-suited to capture population and environmental heterogeneity, but their\nrapid deployment raised questions about utility for health policy. We\nsystematically reviewed 536 COVID-19 ABM studies published from January 2020 to\nDecember 2023, retrieved from Web of Science, PubMed, and Wiley on January 30,\n2024. Studies were included if they used ABMs to simulate COVID-19\ntransmission, where reviews were excluded. Studies were assessed against nine\ncriteria of model usefulness, including transparency and re-use,\ninterdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder engagement, and evaluation\npractices. Publications peaked in late 2021 and were concentrated in a few\ncountries. Most models explored behavioral or policy interventions (n = 294,\n54.85%) rather than real-time forecasting (n = 9, 1.68%). While most described\nmodel assumptions (n = 491, 91.60%), fewer disclosed limitations (n = 349,\n65.11%), shared code (n = 219, 40.86%), or built on existing models (n = 195,\n36.38%). Standardized reporting protocols (n = 36, 6.72%) and stakeholder\nengagement were rare (13.62%, n = 73). Only 2.24% (n = 12) described a\ncomprehensive validation framework, though uncertainty was often quantified (n\n= 407, 75.93%). Limitations of this review include underrepresentation of\nnon-English studies, subjective data extraction, variability in study quality,\nand limited generalizability.

However,\ntheir inability to reliably execute toggle control instructions remains a key\nbottleneck. To investigate this, we construct a state control benchmark with\nbinary toggle instructions from public datasets. Evaluations of existing agents\ndemonstrate their unreliability, particularly when the current toggle state\nalready matches the desired state. To address the challenge, we propose\nState-aware Reasoning (StaR), a training method that teaches agents to perceive\nthe current toggle state, analyze the desired state from the instruction, and\nact accordingly. Experiments on three multimodal agents demonstrate that StaR\ncan improve toggle instruction execution accuracy by over 30\\%. Further\nevaluations on three public benchmarks show that StaR also enhances general\ntask performance. Finally, evaluations on a dynamic environment highlight the\npotential of StaR for real-world applications. Code, benchmark, and\nStaR-enhanced agents are available at https://github.com/ZrW00/StaR."}

Its operations, however,\npose significant challenges due to the escalating system complexity,\nmulti-vendor integration, and a shortage of expert operators. While Robotic\nProcess Automation (RPA) offers partial automation through handcrafted scripts,\nit suffers from limited flexibility and high maintenance costs. Recent advances\nin Large Language Model (LLM)-based graphical user interface (GUI) agents have\nenabled more flexible automation, yet these general-purpose agents face five\ncritical challenges when applied to industrial management, including unfamiliar\nelement understanding, precision and efficiency, state localization, deployment\nconstraints, and safety requirements. To address these issues, we propose\nInfraMind, a novel exploration-based GUI agentic framework specifically\ntailored for industrial management systems. InfraMind integrates five\ninnovative modules to systematically resolve different challenges in industrial\nmanagement: (1) systematic search-based exploration with virtual machine\nsnapshots for autonomous understanding of complex GUIs; (2) memory-driven\nplanning to ensure high-precision and efficient task execution; (3) advanced\nstate identification for robust localization in hierarchical interfaces; (4)\nstructured knowledge distillation for efficient deployment with lightweight\nmodels; and (5) comprehensive, multi-layered safety mechanisms to safeguard\nsensitive operations. Extensive experiments on both open-source and commercial\nDCIM platforms demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing\nframeworks in terms of task success rate and operational efficiency, providing\na rigorous and scalable solution for industrial management automation."}

Integrating external\ntools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent\nadvances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing\ntool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and\nenhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR\n(Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen,\na multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality\ndatasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and\ngeneralizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained\nhierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes\nfor both trajectory-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This\nis motivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call\nis a strong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR\nincorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback\nto dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach\ndemonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing\neffectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models. It further achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for models of a similar scale on multiple\nmathematical benchmarks, while also delivering consistent improvements on code\nbenchmarks.

More recently it\nhas been proposed that cognition might also have evolved via a series of major\ntransitions that manipulate the structure of biological neural networks,\nfundamentally changing the flow of information. We used idealised models of\ninformation flow, artificial neural networks (ANNs), to evaluate whether\nchanges in information flow in a network can yield a transitional change in\ncognitive performance. We compared networks with feed-forward, recurrent and\nlaminated topologies, and tested their performance learning artificial grammars\nthat differed in complexity, controlling for network size and resources. We\ndocumented a qualitative expansion in the types of input that recurrent\nnetworks can process compared to feed-forward networks, and a related\nqualitative increase in performance for learning the most complex grammars. We\nalso noted how the difficulty in training recurrent networks poses a form of\ntransition barrier and contingent irreversibility -- other key features of\nevolutionary transitions. Not all changes in network topology confer a\nperformance advantage in this task set. Laminated networks did not outperform\nnon-laminated networks in grammar learning. Overall, our findings show how some\nchanges in information flow can yield transitions in cognitive performance."}

Existing theory hypothesizes that\nsecond-order learning -- learning mechanisms that adapt first-order learning\n(i.e., learning about the task/domain) -- promotes the emergence of such\nenvironment-cognition isomorphism. In this paper, we empirically validate this\nhypothesis by proposing a hierarchical architecture comprising a Graph\nConvolutional Network (GCN) as a first-order learner and an MLP controller as a\nsecond-order learner. The GCN directly maps node-level features to predictions\nof optimal navigation paths, while the MLP dynamically adapts the GCN's\nparameters when confronting structurally novel maze environments. We\ndemonstrate that second-order learning is particularly effective when the\ncognitive system develops an internal mental map structurally isomorphic to the\nenvironment.
