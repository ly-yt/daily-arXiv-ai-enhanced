However, existing\nmethods predominantly focus on designing policies based on individual agent\ncharacteristics, often neglecting the interplay and mutual influence among\nagents during policy formation. To address this gap, we propose Competitive\nDiversity through Constructive Conflict (CoDiCon), a novel approach that\nincorporates competitive incentives into cooperative scenarios to encourage\npolicy exchange and foster strategic diversity among agents. Drawing\ninspiration from sociological research, which highlights the benefits of\nmoderate competition and constructive conflict in group decision-making, we\ndesign an intrinsic reward mechanism using ranking features to introduce\ncompetitive motivations. A centralized intrinsic reward module generates and\ndistributes varying reward values to agents, ensuring an effective balance\nbetween competition and cooperation. By optimizing the parameterized\ncentralized reward module to maximize environmental rewards, we reformulate the\nconstrained bilevel optimization problem to align with the original task\nobjectives. We evaluate our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods in the\nSMAC and GRF environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDiCon\nachieves superior performance, with competitive intrinsic rewards effectively\npromoting diverse and adaptive strategies among cooperative agents."}

A central component of\nthis framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed\nsecurity layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large\nlanguage models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification,\nand cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee\ninter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and\naccess controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the\nidea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator\nAgent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In\naddition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on\nthese alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents,\nand contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This\ndual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel\nAgents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic\nand adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt\ninjection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy\nbreaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks.

Drawing inspiration from the human\nbrain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to\nthe development of foundational cognitive architectures. We define True\nIntelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied\nsensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a\nhighly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and\nlastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize\nresults in consciousness and a subjective experience.

This study introduces an eXplainable AI modeling\nframework to investigate CPE impact on patient outcomes from Electronic Medical\nRecords data of an Irish hospital. We analyzed an inpatient dataset from an\nIrish acute hospital, incorporating diagnostic codes, ward transitions, patient\ndemographics, infection-related variables and contact network features. Several\nTransformer-based architectures were benchmarked alongside traditional machine\nlearning models. Clinical outcomes were predicted, and XAI techniques were\napplied to interpret model decisions. Our framework successfully demonstrated\nthe utility of Transformer-based models, with TabTransformer consistently\noutperforming baselines across multiple clinical prediction tasks, especially\nfor CPE acquisition (AUROC and sensitivity). We found infection-related\nfeatures, including historical hospital exposure, admission context, and\nnetwork centrality measures, to be highly influential in predicting patient\noutcomes and CPE acquisition risk. Explainability analyses revealed that\nfeatures like \"Area of Residence\", \"Admission Ward\" and prior admissions are\nkey risk factors. Network variables like \"Ward PageRank\" also ranked highly,\nreflecting the potential value of structural exposure information.

A central component of\nthis framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed\nsecurity layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large\nlanguage models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification,\nand cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee\ninter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and\naccess controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the\nidea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator\nAgent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In\naddition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on\nthese alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents,\nand contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This\ndual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel\nAgents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic\nand adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt\ninjection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy\nbreaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks. In addition to the architectural\ndesign, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different\nfamilies (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected\ninto a multi-agent conversational environment. The Sentinel Agents successfully\ndetected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the\nproposed monitoring approach.

We frame VAI as a Hierarchical Adversarial Decentralized Mean Field\nControl (HAD-MFC), where the upper level involves an NP-hard combinatorial task\nof selecting the most vulnerable agents, and the lower level learns worst-case\nadversarial policies for these agents using mean-field MARL.
