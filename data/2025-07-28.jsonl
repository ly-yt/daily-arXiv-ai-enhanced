To stay competitive, enterprises strive to\nremain agile through the implementation of efficient and effective\ndecision-making strategies in reaction to disruptions. A significant effort has\nbeen made to develop these agile disruption mitigation approaches, leveraging\nboth centralized and distributed decision-making strategies. Though trade-offs\nof centralized and distributed approaches have been analyzed in existing\nstudies, no related work has been found on understanding supply chain\nperformance based on the network attributes of the disrupted supply chain\nentities. In this paper, we characterize supply chains from a capability and\nnetwork topological perspective and investigate the use of a distributed\ndecision-making approach based on classical multi-agent frameworks. The\nperformance of the distributed framework is evaluated through a comprehensive\ncase study that investigates the performance of the supply chain as a function\nof the network structure and agent attributes within the network in the\npresence of a disruption. Comparison to a centralized decision-making approach\nhighlights trade-offs between performance, computation time, and network\ncommunication based on the decision-making strategy and network architecture.\nPractitioners can use the outcomes of our studies to design response strategies\nbased on agent capabilities, network attributes, and desired supply chain\nperformance."}

To stay\ncompetitive, flexible and real-time manufacturing decision-making strategies\nare needed to deal with such highly dynamic manufacturing environments. One\nessential problem is dynamic resource allocation to complete production tasks,\nespecially when a resource disruption (e.g., machine breakdown) occurs. Though\nmulti-agent methods have been proposed to solve the problem in a flexible and\nagile manner, the agent internal decision-making process and resource\nuncertainties have rarely been studied. This work introduces a model-based\nresource agent (RA) architecture that enables effective agent coordination and\ndynamic agent decision-making. Based on the RA architecture, a rescheduling\nstrategy that incorporates risk assessment via a clustering agent coordination\nstrategy is also proposed. A simulation-based case study is implemented to\ndemonstrate dynamic rescheduling using the proposed multi-agent framework. The\nresults show that the proposed method reduces the computational efforts while\nlosing some throughput optimality compared to the centralized method.\nFurthermore, the case study illustrates that incorporating risk assessment into\nrescheduling decision-making improves the throughput."}

Human cognition achieves this flexibility via the interplay of the\nhippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC): the hippocampus rapidly encodes\nepisodes, and the prefrontal cortex consolidates them into reusable schemas for\nreasoning. Drawing on these insights, we present MIRAGE (Meta-Inference with\nRules and Abstractions from Generalized Experience), a framework that achieves\nsystematic generalization on compositional tasks. MIRAGE has two interacting\nmodules mirroring the brain's deliberative HPC-PFC loop and intuitive\nneocortical pattern recognition. (1) The meta-trained Transformer Neural\nDecomposer, paralleling neocortical \"System 1\" computation, is trained on a\ntask-agnostic stream of randomly sampled compositional grammars and applies one\ndecomposition step per pass, with successive passes iteratively refining the\nsequence representation.

By structurally separating\nmacro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear\nprogramming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the\nmethod efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures\nrigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying\nsizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic\nalgorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and\nconsistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows."}
