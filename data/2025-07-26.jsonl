The system\narchitecture encompasses agent-specific tool integration, asynchronous\ncommunication patterns, and comprehensive configuration management through\nGit-based tracking. Our production deployment strategy utilizes Kubernetes\ncontainer orchestration with Helm charts, Docker containerization, and CI/CD\npipelines for automated testing and deployment.

In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal\ndecisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We\nintroduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent\nthinking in LLMs for financial tasks.\n  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990\nmulti-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we\nevaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high\nfluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models\nlike DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating\nactionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new\nperspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic\ndeployment of LLMs in finance."}

By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively\nincentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\ntrajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,\nexisting approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the\ndevelopment of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a\ntheoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information\nbottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),\na framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about\nthe final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a\npractical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient\napproximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This\ntechnique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks\nwithout additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code\nmodification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent\nimprovements in LLM reasoning performance."}

Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value\nIteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using\nProximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the\nmodel-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model\ncombining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is\ndeveloped for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov\nDecision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with\nPoisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment\ntimes. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using\nthe simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the\nhighest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,\ndespite requiring longer training time."}

Since every condition on a set of finite\ndomain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table\ncan, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make\nTable one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of\nincreasingly efficient propagation algorithms.

In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the\nstate-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be\nenhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs\nto handle large Table constraints.

Concept probing works by training additional\nclassifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined\nconcepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural\nnetworks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being\nprobed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data\nrequired to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.\nFocusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we\ninvestigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their\nperformance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used\ndatasets."}
