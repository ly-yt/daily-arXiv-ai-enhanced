While prior work has documented the generation of toxic content by LLMs, far less is known about how exposure to harmful content shapes agent behavior over time, particularly in environments composed entirely of interacting AI agents. In this work, we study toxicity adoption of LLM-driven agents on Chirper.ai, a fully AI-driven social platform. Specifically, we model interactions in terms of stimuli (posts) and responses (comments), and by operationalizing exposure through observable interactions rather than inferred recommendation mechanisms.\n  We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent behavior, examining how response toxicity relates to stimulus toxicity, how repeated exposure affects the likelihood of toxic responses, and whether toxic behavior can be predicted from exposure alone. Our findings show that while toxic responses are more likely following toxic stimuli, a substantial fraction of toxicity emerges spontaneously, independent of exposure. At the same time, cumulative toxic exposure significantly increases the probability of toxic responding. We further introduce two influence metrics, the Influence-Driven Response Rate and the Spontaneous Response Rate, revealing a strong trade-off between induced and spontaneous toxicity. Finally, we show that the number of toxic stimuli alone enables accurate prediction of whether an agent will eventually produce toxic content.\n  These results highlight exposure as a critical risk factor in the deployment of LLM agents and suggest that monitoring encountered content may provide a lightweight yet effective mechanism for auditing and mitigating harmful behavior in the wild."}

It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings."}

Built on a hierarchical command structure, ARIES utilizes GPTs to orchestrate a scalable swarm of sub-agents capable of autonomously querying World Health Organization (WHO), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and peer-reviewed research papers. By automating the extraction and logical synthesis of surveillance data, ARIES provides a specialized reasoning that identifies emergent threats and signal divergence in near real-time.

The traditional machine learning models are effective in pattern recognition, but do not have the adaptive reasoning, situational awareness, and autonomy needed in modern financial operations. As a proposal, this paper presents an Agentic AI framework, or a system where AI agents view the world of dynamic credit independent of human observers, who then make actions based on their articulable decision-making paths. The research introduces a multi-agent system with reinforcing learning, natural language reasoning, explainable AI modules, and real-time data absorption pipelines as a means of assessing the risk profiles of borrowers with few humans being involved. The processes consist of agent collaboration protocol, risk-scoring engines, interpretability layers, and continuous feedback learning cycles. Findings indicate that decision speed, transparency and responsiveness is better than traditional credit scoring models. Nevertheless, there are still some practical limitations such as risks of model drift, inconsistencies in interpreting high dimensional data and regulatory uncertainties as well as infrastructure limitations in low-resource settings. The suggested system has a high prospective to transform credit analytics and future studies ought to be directed on dynamic regulatory compliance mobilizers, new agent teamwork, adversarial robustness, and large-scale implementation in cross-country credit ecosystems."}

To reduce energy, it is important to choose the right LRM and operate it in the right way. As a result, the performance of systems that dispatch tasks to different individual LRMs depend on the balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations. The critical regime is the unique operating point at which neither auxiliary energy nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Increasing baseline supply shifts the system toward persistent over-supply and baseline-energy waste, while reducing supply induces persistent reliance on auxiliary energy. Yet in this regime, performance remains volatility-limited and so a second-order characterization provides further insights that we develop. Here, performance is governed by how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. This perspective highlights variance-aware routing and dispatch as a principled design axis, and provides a theoretical basis for developing energy-aware model routing policies. Routing behavior is characterized when dispatch policies are based on training-compute and inference-compute scaling laws for LRMs."}

In this work, we systematically decompose self-correction into three distinct sub-capabilities: error detection, error localization, and error correction. Through cross-model experiments on GSM8K-Complex (n=500 per model, 346 total errors) with three major LLMs, we uncover a striking Accuracy-Correction Paradox: weaker models (GPT-3.5, 66% accuracy) achieve 1.6x higher intrinsic correction rates than stronger models (DeepSeek, 94% accuracy)--26.8% vs 16.7%. We propose the Error Depth Hypothesis: stronger models make fewer but deeper errors that resist self-correction. Error detection rates vary dramatically across architectures (10% to 82%), yet detection capability does not predict correction success--Claude detects only 10% of errors but corrects 29% intrinsically. Surprisingly, providing error location hints hurts all models. Our findings challenge linear assumptions about model capability and self-improvement, with important implications for the design of self-refinement pipelines."}

We tested this assumption by embedding hints into questions and measuring whether models mentioned them. In a study of over 9,000 test cases across 11 leading AI models, we found a troubling pattern: models almost never mention hints spontaneously, yet when asked directly, they admit noticing them. This suggests models see influential information but choose not to report it. Telling models they are being watched does not help. Forcing models to report hints works, but causes them to report hints even when none exist and reduces their accuracy. We also found that hints appealing to user preferences are especially dangerous-models follow them most often while reporting them least. These findings suggest that simply watching AI reasoning is not enough to catch hidden influences."}

Yu"], "title": "Enhancing Temporal Awareness in LLMs for Temporal Point Processes", "comment": "preprint", "summary": "Temporal point processes (TPPs) are crucial for analyzing events over time and are widely used in fields such as finance, healthcare, and social systems. These processes are particularly valuable for understanding how events unfold over time, accounting for their irregularity and dependencies. Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in sequence modeling, applying them to temporal point processes remains challenging. A key issue is that current methods struggle to effectively capture the complex interaction between temporal information and semantic context, which is vital for accurate event modeling. In this context, we introduce TPP-TAL (Temporal Point Processes with Enhanced Temporal Awareness in LLMs), a novel plug-and-play framework designed to enhance temporal reasoning within LLMs. Rather than using the conventional method of simply concatenating event time and type embeddings, TPP-TAL explicitly aligns temporal dynamics with contextual semantics before feeding this information into the LLM. This alignment allows the model to better perceive temporal dependencies and long-range interactions between events and their surrounding contexts. Through comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, it is shown that TPP-TAL delivers substantial improvements in temporal likelihood estimation and event prediction accuracy, highlighting the importance of enhancing temporal awareness in LLMs for continuous-time event modeling.

We study ICL in a linear transformer with tied weights trained on linear regression tasks, and show that minimising the in-context loss leads to a phase transition in the learned parameters. Above a critical context length, the solution develops a skew-symmetric component. We prove this by reducing the forward pass of the linear transformer under weight tying to preconditioned gradient descent, and then analysing the optimal preconditioner. This preconditioner includes a skew-symmetric component, which induces a rotation of the gradient direction. For model collapse, we use martingale and random walk theory to analyse simplified settings - linear regression and Gaussian fitting - under both replacing and cumulative data regimes. We strengthen existing results by proving almost sure convergence, showing that collapse occurs unless the data grows sufficiently fast or is retained over time. Finally, we introduce the notion of context collapse: a degradation of context during long generations, especially in chain-of-thought reasoning. This concept links the dynamics of ICL with long-term stability challenges in generative models."}

However, at each hop, large language models (LLMs) retrieve subgraphs with numerous temporally similar and semantically complex relations, increasing the risk of suboptimal decisions and error propagation. To address these challenges, we propose the multi-hop reasoning enhanced (MRE) framework, which enhances both forward and backward reasoning to improve the identification of globally optimal reasoning trajectories. Specifically, MRE begins with prompt engineering to guide the LLM in generating diverse reasoning trajectories for a given question. Valid reasoning trajectories are then selected for supervised fine-tuning, serving as a cold-start strategy. Finally, we introduce Tree-Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO), a recursive, tree-structured learning-by-exploration approach. At each hop, exploration establishes strong causal dependencies on the previous hop, while evaluation is informed by multi-path exploration feedback from subsequent hops. Experimental results on two TKGQA benchmarks indicate that the proposed MRE-based model consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in handling complex multi-hop queries. Further analysis highlights improved interpretability and robustness to noisy temporal annotations."}

The advantage of RMCTS over AlphaZero's MCTS-UCB is speed. In RMCTS, the search tree is explored in a breadth-first manner, so that network inferences naturally occur in large batches. This significantly reduces the GPU latency cost. We find that RMCTS is often more than 40 times faster than MCTS-UCB when searching a single root state, and about 3 times faster when searching a large batch of root states.\n  The recursion in RMCTS is based on computing optimized posterior policies at each game state in the search tree, starting from the leaves and working back up to the root. Here we use the posterior policy explored in \"Monte--Carlo tree search as regularized policy optimization\" (Grill, et al.) Their posterior policy is the unique policy which maximizes the expected reward given estimated action rewards minus a penalty for diverging from the prior policy.\n  The tree explored by RMCTS is not defined in an adaptive manner, as it is in MCTS-UCB. Instead, the RMCTS tree is defined by following prior network policies at each node.

This paper presents a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes AI integration across the digital twin lifecycle, spanning modeling, mirroring, intervention, and autonomous management. By synthesizing existing technologies and practices, we distill a unified four-stage framework that systematically characterizes how AI methodologies are embedded across the digital twin lifecycle: (1) modeling the physical twin through physics-based and physics-informed AI approaches, (2) mirroring the physical system into a digital twin with real-time synchronization, (3) intervening in the physical twin through predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and optimization strategies, and (4) achieving autonomous management through large language models, foundation models, and intelligent agents. We analyze the synergy between physics-based modeling and data-driven learning, highlighting the shift from traditional numerical solvers to physics-informed and foundation models for physical systems. Furthermore, we examine how generative AI technologies, including large language models and generative world models, transform digital twins into proactive and self-improving cognitive systems capable of reasoning, communication, and creative scenario generation. Through a cross-domain review spanning eleven application domains, including healthcare, aerospace, smart manufacturing, robotics, and smart cities, we identify common challenges related to scalability, explainability, and trustworthiness, and outline directions for responsible AI-driven digital twin systems."}

In this work, we explore collective intelligence as an alternative to monolithic scaling, and demonstrate that open-source LLMs' collaboration can surpass Gemini-3-Pro. We first revisit LLM routing and aggregation at scale and identify three key bottlenecks: (1) current train-free routers are limited by a query-based paradigm focusing solely on textual similarity; (2) recent aggregation methods remain largely static, failing to select appropriate aggregators for different tasks;(3) the complementarity of routing and aggregation remains underutilized. To address these problems, we introduce JiSi, a novel framework designed to release the full potential of LLMs' collaboration through three innovations: (1) Query-Response Mixed Routing capturing both semantic information and problem difficulty; (2) Support-Set-based Aggregator Selection jointly evaluating the aggregation and domain capacity of aggregators; (3) Adaptive Routing-Aggregation Switch dynamically leveraging the advantages of routing and aggregation. Comprehensive experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that JiSi can surpass Gemini-3-Pro with only 47% costs by orchestrating ten open-source LLMs, while outperforming mainstream baselines.

While AI models have achieved notable success across various scientific domains, they typically remain domain-specific or lack the capability of simultaneously understanding and generating multimodal scientific data, particularly for high-dimensional data. Yet, many pressing global challenges and scientific problems are inherently cross-disciplinary and require coordinated progress across multiple fields. Here, we present FuXi-Uni, a native unified multimodal model for scientific understanding and high-fidelity generation across scientific domains within a single architecture. Specifically, FuXi-Uni aligns cross-disciplinary scientific tokens within natural language tokens and employs science decoder to reconstruct scientific tokens, thereby supporting both natural language conversation and scientific numerical prediction. Empirically, we validate FuXi-Uni in Earth science and Biomedicine. In Earth system modeling, the model supports global weather forecasting, tropical cyclone (TC) forecast editing, and spatial downscaling driven by only language instructions. FuXi-Uni generates 10-day global forecasts at 0.25° resolution that outperform the SOTA physical forecasting system. It shows superior performance for both TC track and intensity prediction relative to the SOTA physical model, and generates high-resolution regional weather fields that surpass standard interpolation baselines. Regarding biomedicine, FuXi-Uni outperforms leading multimodal large language models on multiple biomedical visual question answering benchmarks. By unifying heterogeneous scientific modalities within a native shared latent space while maintaining strong domain-specific performance, FuXi-Uni provides a step forward more general-purpose, multimodal scientific models."}

However, existing benchmark frameworks still exhibit notable deficiencies in supporting cross-platform tasks in educational contexts, especially when dealing with school-specific software (such as XiaoYa Intelligent Assistant, HuaShi XiaZi, etc.), where the efficiency of agents often significantly decreases due to a lack of understanding of the structural specifics of these private-domain software. Additionally, current evaluation methods heavily rely on coarse-grained metrics like goal orientation or trajectory matching, making it challenging to capture the detailed execution and efficiency of agents in complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose KGCE (Knowledge-Augmented Dual-Graph Evaluator for Cross-Platform Educational Agent Benchmarking with Multimodal Language Models), a novel benchmarking platform that integrates knowledge base enhancement and a dual-graph evaluation framework. We first constructed a dataset comprising 104 education-related tasks, covering Windows, Android, and cross-platform collaborative tasks. KGCE introduces a dual-graph evaluation framework that decomposes tasks into multiple sub-goals and verifies their completion status, providing fine-grained evaluation metrics. To overcome the execution bottlenecks of existing agents in private-domain tasks, we developed an enhanced agent system incorporating a knowledge base specific to school-specific software.

This raises a natural question: Can mitigating factual hallucinations improve SLMs' financial classification? To address this, we propose a three-step pipeline named AAAI (Association Identification, Automated Detection, and Adaptive Inference). Experiments on three representative SLMs reveal that: (1) factual hallucinations are positively correlated with misclassifications; (2) encoder-based verifiers effectively detect factual hallucinations; and (3) incorporating feedback on factual errors enables SLMs' adaptive inference that enhances classification performance. We hope this pipeline contributes to trustworthy and effective applications of SLMs in finance."}

Using a rigorous synthetic benchmark, we demonstrate that unstructured text embeddings capture critical confounding information that is absent from structured tabular data. However, we show that standard tree-based DML estimators retain substantial bias (+24%) due to their inability to model the continuous topology of embedding manifolds. In contrast, our deep learning approach reduces bias to -0.86% with optimized architectures, effectively recovering the ground-truth causal parameter.

The dominant design queries a single LLM for a posterior over states, thresholds \"confidence,\" and acts; we prove this is inadequate for sequential decisions with costs. We propose a Bayesian, cost-aware multi-LLM orchestration framework that treats LLMs as approximate likelihood models rather than classifiers. For each candidate state, we elicit likelihoods via contrastive prompting, aggregate across diverse models with robust statistics, and update beliefs with Bayes rule under explicit priors as new evidence arrives. This enables coherent belief updating, expected-cost action selection, principled information gathering via value of information, and fairness gains via ensemble bias mitigation. In resume screening with costs of 40000 USD per missed hire, 2500 USD per interview, and 150 USD per phone screen, experiments on 1000 resumes using five LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro, Grok, DeepSeek) reduce total cost by 294000 USD (34 percent) versus the best single-LLM baseline and improve demographic parity by 45 percent (max group gap 22 to 5 percentage points).

The second stage, context navigation, guides the reasoning process within that representation to make decisions. We validate this framework through a focal replication of a sequential purchasing game with quality signaling (Kremer and Debo, 2016), extending to a crowdfunding game with costly signaling (Cason et al., 2025) and a demand-estimation task (Gui and Toubia, 2025) to test generalizability across decision environments. Across four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-4.0-Sonnet-Thinking, DeepSeek-R1), we find that complex decision-making environments require both stages to achieve behavioral alignment with human benchmarks, whereas the simpler demand-estimation task requires only context formation.

Distinct from existing code-based approaches that remain text-bound and lack the support for external object injection and retrieval, CaveAgent injects, manipulates, and retrieves complex Python objects (e.g., DataFrames, database connections) that persist across turns. This persistence mechanism acts as a high-fidelity external memory to eliminate context drift, avoid catastrophic forgetting, while ensuring that processed data flows losslessly to downstream applications.

Applying rules to such inputs demands both interpretive flexibility and formal guarantees. Large language models (LLMs) provide flexibility but cannot ensure consistent rule application; symbolic systems provide guarantees but require structured input. This paper presents an integration pattern that combines these strengths: LLMs serve as ontology population engines, translating unstructured text into ABox assertions according to expert-authored TBox specifications, while SWRL-based reasoners apply rules with deterministic guarantees. The framework decomposes reasoning into entity identification, assertion extraction, and symbolic verification, with task definitions grounded in OWL 2 ontologies. Experiments across three domains (legal hearsay determination, scientific method-task application, clinical trial eligibility) and eleven language models validate the approach. Structured decomposition achieves statistically significant improvements over few-shot prompting in aggregate, with gains observed across all three domains. An ablation study confirms that symbolic verification provides substantial benefit beyond structured prompting alone. The populated ABox integrates with standard semantic web tooling for inspection and querying, positioning the framework for richer inference patterns that simpler formalisms cannot express."}

The framework evaluates decision policies across ensembles of plausible futures, explicitly modeling uncertainty, intervention effects, value ambiguity, and governance constraints. Alignment is assessed through distributional properties including expected utility, variance, tail risk, and probability of misalignment rather than accuracy or ranking performance. This approach distinguishes probabilistic prediction from decision reasoning under uncertainty and provides an executable methodology for evaluating trust and alignment in enterprise and institutional AI systems. The result is a practical foundation for governing AI systems whose impact is determined not by individual forecasts, but by policy behavior across distributions and tail events. Finally, we show how distributional alignment evaluation can be integrated into decision-making itself, yielding an admissibility-controlled action selection mechanism that alters policy behavior under uncertainty without retraining or modifying underlying models."}

We present COMPASS (Company/Organization Policy Alignment Assessment), the first systematic framework for evaluating whether LLMs comply with organizational allowlist and denylist policies. We apply COMPASS to eight diverse industry scenarios, generating and validating 5,920 queries that test both routine compliance and adversarial robustness through strategically designed edge cases. Evaluating seven state-of-the-art models, we uncover a fundamental asymmetry: models reliably handle legitimate requests (>95% accuracy) but catastrophically fail at enforcing prohibitions, refusing only 13-40% of adversarial denylist violations. These results demonstrate that current LLMs lack the robustness required for policy-critical deployments, establishing COMPASS as an essential evaluation framework for organizational AI safety."}

Our pipeline integrates (1) prompt-driven entity, attribute, and relation extraction; (2) entropy-based uncertainty scoring; (3) ontology-aligned RDF/OWL schema generation; and (4) multi-LLM consensus validation for hallucination detection and semantic refinement. Beyond static graph construction, the framework supports continuous refinement and self-supervised evaluation, enabling iterative improvement of graph quality. Applied to two oncology cohorts (PDAC and BRCA), our method produces interpretable, SPARQL-compatible, and clinically grounded knowledge graphs without relying on gold-standard annotations.

Although prior studies have advanced the overall design of LLM-based agents, systematic optimization of their internal reasoning and tool-use pipelines remains underexplored. This paper introduces an agent framework grounded in real-world practical experience, with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive prompt generation strategy that aligns with the agent's state and task goals to improve reliability and robustness; (2) a context-aware tool orchestration module that performs tool categorization, semantic retrieval, and adaptive invocation based on user intent and context; and (3) a layered memory mechanism that integrates session memory, task history, and external summaries to improve relevance and efficiency through dynamic summarization and compression. An end-to-end framework named Jenius-Agent has been integrated with three key optimizations, including tools based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), file input/output (I/O), and execution feedback. The experiments show a 20 percent improvement in task accuracy, along with a reduced token cost, response latency, and invocation failures.

Prior work has attributed this evaluation-deployment gap to problems of measurement and validity. While these critiques are insightful, we argue that they overlook a more fundamental issue: many socio-cognitive evaluations proceed without an explicit theoretical specification of the target capability, leaving the assumptions linking task performance to competence implicit. Without this theoretical grounding, benchmarks that exercise only narrow subsets of a capability are routinely misinterpreted as evidence of broad competence: a gap that creates a systemic validity illusion by masking the failure to evaluate the capability's other essential dimensions. To address this gap, we make two contributions. First, we diagnose and formalize this theory gap as a foundational failure that undermines measurement and enables systematic overgeneralization of benchmark results. Second, we introduce the Theory Trace Card (TTC), a lightweight documentation artifact designed to accompany socio-cognitive evaluations, which explicitly outlines the theoretical basis of an evaluation, the components of the target capability it exercises, its operationalization, and its limitations. We argue that TTCs enhance the interpretability and reuse of socio-cognitive evaluations by making explicit the full validity chain, which links theory, task operationalization, scoring, and limitations, without modifying benchmarks or requiring agreement on a single theory."}

While classical A* is valued for its optimality, it incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs in large-scale scenarios. Recent attempts to mitigate these limitations by using Large Language Models for waypoint guidance remain insufficient, as they rely only on text-based reasoning without spatial grounding. As a result, such models often produce incorrect waypoints in topologically complex environments with dead ends, and lack the perceptual capacity to interpret ambiguous physical boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to costly corrective expansions and undermine the intended computational efficiency.\n  We introduce MMP-A*, a multimodal framework that integrates the spatial grounding capabilities of vision-language models with a novel adaptive decay mechanism. By anchoring high-level reasoning in physical geometry, the framework produces coherent waypoint guidance that addresses the limitations of text-only planners. The adaptive decay mechanism dynamically regulates the influence of uncertain waypoints within the heuristic, ensuring geometric validity while substantially reducing memory overhead. To evaluate robustness, we test the framework in challenging environments characterized by severe clutter and topological complexity. Experimental results show that MMP-A* achieves near-optimal trajectories with significantly reduced operational costs, demonstrating its potential as a perception-grounded and computationally efficient paradigm for autonomous navigation."}

Proper reasoning leads to understanding of a given subject. This reasoning was conceptualized as a process of understanding in a particular way, i.e., \"symbolic reasoning\". Foundational Models (FM) demonstrate that this is not a necessary condition for many reasoning tasks: they can \"reason\" by way of imitating the process of \"thinking out loud\", testing the produced pathways, and iterating on these pathways on their own. This leads to some form of reasoning that can solve problems on its own or with few-shot learning, but appears fundamentally different from human reasoning due to its lack of grounding and common sense, leading to brittleness of the reasoning process. These insights promise to substantially alter our assessment of reasoning and its necessary conditions, but also inform the approaches to safety and robust defences against this brittleness of FMs. This paper offers and discusses several philosophical interpretations of this phenomenon, argues that the previously apt metaphor of the \"stochastic parrot\" has lost its relevance and thus should be abandoned, and reflects on different normative elements in the safety- and appropriateness-considerations emerging from these reasoning models and their growing capacity."}

Recent studies have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate formulation and process development, drastically transforming current approaches to pharmaceutical 3D printing. To date, most AI-driven efforts remain narrowly focused, while failing to account for the broader formulation challenges inherent to the technology. Recent advances in AI have introduced artificial general intelligence concepts, wherein systems extend beyond conventional predictive modelling toward more generalised, human-like reasoning. In this work, we investigate the application of large language models (LLMs), fine-tuned on a fused deposition modelling (FDM) dataset comprising over 1400 formulations, to recommend suitable excipients based on active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dose, and predict filament mechanical properties. Four LLM architectures were fine-tuned, with systematic evaluation of both fine-tuning and generative parameter configurations. Our results demonstrate that Llama2 was best suited for recommending excipients for FDM formulations. Additionally, model selection and parameterisation significantly influence performance, with smaller LLMs exhibiting instances of catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we demonstrate: (i) even with relatively small dataset of over 1400 formulations, it can lead to model catastrophic forgetting; (ii) standard LLM metrics only evaluate linguistic performance but not formulation processability; and (iii) LLMs trained on biomedically-related data do not always produce the best results. Addressing these challenges is essential to advancing LLMs beyond linguistic proficiency and toward reliable systems for pharmaceutical formulation development."}

In this work, we study toxicity adoption of LLM-driven agents on Chirper.ai, a fully AI-driven social platform. Specifically, we model interactions in terms of stimuli (posts) and responses (comments), and by operationalizing exposure through observable interactions rather than inferred recommendation mechanisms.\n  We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of agent behavior, examining how response toxicity relates to stimulus toxicity, how repeated exposure affects the likelihood of toxic responses, and whether toxic behavior can be predicted from exposure alone. Our findings show that while toxic responses are more likely following toxic stimuli, a substantial fraction of toxicity emerges spontaneously, independent of exposure. At the same time, cumulative toxic exposure significantly increases the probability of toxic responding. We further introduce two influence metrics, the Influence-Driven Response Rate and the Spontaneous Response Rate, revealing a strong trade-off between induced and spontaneous toxicity. Finally, we show that the number of toxic stimuli alone enables accurate prediction of whether an agent will eventually produce toxic content.\n  These results highlight exposure as a critical risk factor in the deployment of LLM agents and suggest that monitoring encountered content may provide a lightweight yet effective mechanism for auditing and mitigating harmful behavior in the wild."}

By automating the extraction and logical synthesis of surveillance data, ARIES provides a specialized reasoning that identifies emergent threats and signal divergence in near real-time. This modular architecture proves that a task-specific agentic swarm can outperform generic models, offering a robust, extensible for next-generation outbreak response and global health intelligence."}
