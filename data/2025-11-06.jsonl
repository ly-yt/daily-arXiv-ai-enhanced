We present ALAS,\na stateful, disruption-aware framework that separates planning from\nnon-circular validation, records a versioned execution log for grounded checks\nand restore points, and performs localized repair that preserves work in\nprogress. The validator operates independently of the planning LLM with fresh,\nbounded context, avoiding self-check loops and mid-context attrition. The\nrepair protocol edits only the minimal affected region under explicit policies\n(retry, catch, timeout, backoff, idempotency keys, compensation, loop guards)\ndefined in a canonical workflow IR that maps to Amazon States Language and Argo\nWorkflows. On job-shop scheduling suites (DMU, TA) across five classical\nbenchmarks, ALAS matches or exceeds strong single-LLM and multi-agent\nbaselines, achieving 83.7% success, reducing token usage by 60%, and running\n1.82times faster under comparable settings. A minimal reliability study shows\nthat the validator detects injected structural faults with low overhead, and\nthat localized repair contains runtime perturbations with a bounded edit radius\nand less makespan degradation than global recompute.

This architecture maintains focused attention within agent\ncontexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models\nand 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.\nFirst, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the\nstrongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model\nscale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and\nconditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent\neffectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev\n20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or\nanalysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing\nreport or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits\npersist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%\ndiscovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning\nenhancement.

A critical distinction in this\ncontext is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or\nfalse answers (e.g., \"what is the capital of England?\"), and probabilistic\nknowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., \"what\nis the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?\"). In this paper, our goal\nis to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of\nknowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they\ninternalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful\nuniversal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,\nclassical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight\nfundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,\nchallenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we\ndevelop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating\nwhether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world\npopulations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social\nbehavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not\nseem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the\ncontext of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that\nlanguage models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer\n1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional\n(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also\nlimited."}

AAA is anchored by two key innovations: GRASP, a\ngraph-based multimodal sampling method that ensures representative page\ncoverage via learned embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues; and\nMaC, a multimodal large language model-based copilot that supports auditors\nthrough cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks.\nTogether, these components enable scalable, end-to-end web accessibility\nauditing, empowering human auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world\nimpact. We further contribute four novel datasets designed for benchmarking\ncore stages of the audit pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our methods, providing insights that small-scale language\nmodels can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned."}

Contrary to the prevalent black-box perception, our study focuses\non models with transparent internal mechanisms. We address two principal types\nof explanation problems: abductive and contrastive, both in their local and\nglobal variants. Our analysis encompasses diverse ML models, including Decision\nTrees, Decision Sets, Decision Lists, Boolean Circuits, and ensembles thereof,\neach offering unique explanatory challenges. This research fills a significant\ngap in explainable AI (XAI) by providing a foundational understanding of the\ncomplexities of generating explanations for these models. This work provides\ninsights vital for further research in the domain of XAI, contributing to the\nbroader discourse on the necessity of transparency and accountability in AI\nsystems."}

While recent breakthroughs have matched elite\nhuman play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued:\nmost hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple\nrounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to\nachieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized\nby extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a\nmodel-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played\nat an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and\nequity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also\noutperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning\nabilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies,\nrandomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class\nhuman players."}
