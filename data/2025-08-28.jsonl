We\nrun MRT on existing LLM monitor scaffoldings, which orchestrate LLMs and parse\nagent trajectories, alongside a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding\nproposed in this work. Our empirical results yield three key findings. First,\nagent awareness dominates monitor awareness: an agent's knowledge that it is\nbeing monitored substantially degrades the monitor's reliability. On the\ncontrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less\nhelpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor\nawareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor\nscaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents\n-- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where\nhumans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's\nbehavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only\npre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at\nFPR = 0.01.

These have been applied to the job-shop problem\nbefore, but often in a centrally calculated way where they are applied to the\nsolution space, but they can be implemented in a bottom-up fashion to avoid\nglobal result computation as well. One of the problems in semiconductor\nproduction is that the production process requires a lot of switching between\nmachines that process lots one after the other and machines that process\nbatches of lots at once, often with long processing times. In this paper, we\naddress this switching problem with the ``boids'' flocking algorithm that was\noriginally used in robotics and movie industry. The flocking behavior is a\nbio-inspired algorithm that uses only local information and interaction based\non simple heuristics. We show that this algorithm addresses these valid\nconsiderations in production plant optimization, as it reacts to the switching\nof machine kinds similar to how a swarm of flocking animals would react to\nobstacles in its course."}

Existing single-agent\napproaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Although\nmulti-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progress\nin multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered by\ninefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved\nreinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates\nMARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one\nagent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable\ntraining and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we\nprovide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem,\nand convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled\noptimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates a\nNavigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, and\nan Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level and\nlow-level GUI benchmarks. Beyond GUI tasks, SWIRL also demonstrates strong\ncapability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, underscoring its potential as\na general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems."}

Unlike data-centric approaches, Model Science\nplaces the trained model at the core of analysis, aiming to interact, verify,\nexplain, and control its behavior across diverse operational contexts. This\npaper introduces a conceptual framework for a new discipline called Model\nScience, along with the proposal for its four key pillars: Verification, which\nrequires strict, context-aware evaluation protocols; Explanation, which is\nunderstood as various approaches to explore of internal model operations;\nControl, which integrates alignment techniques to steer model behavior; and\nInterface, which develops interactive and visual explanation tools to improve\nhuman calibration and decision-making. The proposed framework aims to guide the\ndevelopment of credible, safe, and human-aligned AI systems."}
