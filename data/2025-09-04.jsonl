A structured thematic\nsynthesis revealed four categories of outcomes: (1) Convergent themes -\ncommitment-based demand signals, black-box trust barriers, and efficiency gains\nwere consistently emphasized across both datasets; (2) Partial overlaps -\nfounders worried about outliers being averaged away and the stress of real\ncustomer validation, while synthetic personas highlighted irrational blind\nspots and framed AI as a psychological buffer; (3) Human-only themes -\nrelational and advocacy value from early customer engagement and skepticism\ntoward moonshot markets; and (4) Synthetic-only themes - amplified false\npositives and trauma blind spots, where AI may overstate adoption potential by\nmissing negative historical experiences.\n  We interpret this comparative framework as evidence that LLM-driven personas\nconstitute a form of hybrid social simulation: more linguistically expressive\nand adaptable than traditional rule-based agents, yet bounded by the absence of\nlived history and relational consequence. Rather than replacing empirical\nstudies, we argue they function as a complementary simulation category -\ncapable of extending hypothesis space, accelerating exploratory validation, and\nclarifying the boundaries of cognitive realism in computational social science."}

The\nsystem is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by\nfinetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model\ninstead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts\ndiscrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the\nparameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including\nlateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and\nlongitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,\ncontinuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently\ninterpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in\noutput size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a\nstate-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating\nperformance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant\nadvantages in explainability and resource efficiency."}

A structured thematic\nsynthesis revealed four categories of outcomes: (1) Convergent themes -\ncommitment-based demand signals, black-box trust barriers, and efficiency gains\nwere consistently emphasized across both datasets; (2) Partial overlaps -\nfounders worried about outliers being averaged away and the stress of real\ncustomer validation, while synthetic personas highlighted irrational blind\nspots and framed AI as a psychological buffer; (3) Human-only themes -\nrelational and advocacy value from early customer engagement and skepticism\ntoward moonshot markets; and (4) Synthetic-only themes - amplified false\npositives and trauma blind spots, where AI may overstate adoption potential by\nmissing negative historical experiences.\n  We interpret this comparative framework as evidence that LLM-driven personas\nconstitute a form of hybrid social simulation: more linguistically expressive\nand adaptable than traditional rule-based agents, yet bounded by the absence of\nlived history and relational consequence. Rather than replacing empirical\nstudies, we argue they function as a complementary simulation category -\ncapable of extending hypothesis space, accelerating exploratory validation, and\nclarifying the boundaries of cognitive realism in computational social science."}

Many complex systems\nof interest, such as epidemics or financial markets, involve thousands or even\nmillions of agents. Consequently, ABMs often become computationally demanding\nand rely on the calibration of numerous free parameters, which has\nsignificantly hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat automatic differentiation (AD) techniques can effectively alleviate these\ncomputational burdens. By applying AD to ABMs, the gradients of the simulator\nbecome readily available, greatly facilitating essential tasks such as\ncalibration and sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show how AD enables\nvariational inference (VI) techniques for efficient parameter calibration. Our\nexperiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements and computational\nsavings using VI on three prominent ABMs: Axtell's model of firms; Sugarscape;\nand the SIR epidemiological model. Our approach thus significantly enhances the\npracticality and scalability of ABMs for studying complex systems."}
