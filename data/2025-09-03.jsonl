We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided\nExploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to\ndynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task\ndifficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal\nto modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is\nstruggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for\neasier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.\nExperiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show\nthat DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models\nnot only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance\nwhen scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters\neffective exploration without sacrificing precision."}

This bridging of natural language understanding with\nsymbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,\nsignificantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.\nEvaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial\nimprovements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\\% accuracy compared to\n18.8\\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between\nreasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular\narchitectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated\nlegal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while\nenhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a\nfoundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and\neffective AI systems for legal domain."}

However, hallucination\nissues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text\nmodality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues\nwhile neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal\nscenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or\nauditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the\nintrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This\noversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden\naudio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose\nOmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations\nin OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing\ntext-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of\naudio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample\npairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.\nBy tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding\nand reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that\nOmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also\nsignificantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.\nAll code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance."}

However, the optimization of\nSharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there\nexist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is\nthat dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other\nis that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we\nstudy the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both\nthe long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge\nwith the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a\nmean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization\nand the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when\nthe risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the\nsecond challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V\noptimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We\niteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that\nis used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V\nproblems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is\nmonotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both\naverage and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure\nand prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted\nfor validation.

Focusing on a\ncommon component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve\nreasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,\nwe find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates\nfails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based\nReasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over\nworld knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable\ngeneration and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework\nachieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x\nhigher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning\ngates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate\nwith real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and\nenvironmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework."}

While\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their\napplication has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within\nhuman-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open\nquestion. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver\nfor the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved\nfragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint\nscaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative\nself-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a\nviable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy\nprocess, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the\nscoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior\nwork may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of\nLLM capabilities.

This paper identifies four core problems that must be\nsolved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)\ngeneralization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,\nspecifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)\nlong-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,\nspecifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We\npresent AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device\nassistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,\nclosed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this\nposition through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,\ntraining, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile\napplication development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal\nfoundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and\ncontrol layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task\nplanning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution\nlayer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice\ninteraction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and\ncomprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates\nprofiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across\nheterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant\nimprovements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,\nhigher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,\nand faster, more resource-efficient runtime."}

While recent advances in\nnative agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,\naction, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data\nscalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of\nGUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we\npresent UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these\nchallenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for\nscalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI\nenvironment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox\nplatform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that\nUI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.\nOn GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on\nWindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines\nsuch as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean\nnormalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level\nperformance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,\nOpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to\nlong-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,\nhighlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of\ntraining dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and\nefficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's\npotential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization\nto real-world interactive scenarios."}

This survey\nformalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step\nMarkov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,\npartially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.\nBuilding on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one\norganized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,\nmemory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their\napplications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that\nreinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these\ncapabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic\nbehavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the\nlandscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a\npractical compendium.
