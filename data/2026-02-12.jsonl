To mitigate the tension between goal stability and reactive correctness, we introduce (i) a hierarchical branch-thinking planner that decomposes life goals into parallel objective branches and uses simulation-guided validation plus tiered re-planning to ensure feasibility; (ii) an adaptive agent profile with dual-process memory that separates short-term execution traces from long-term semantic consolidation, enabling persistent yet evolving identity; and (iii) a human-in-the-loop steering interface that injects long-horizon objectives and short commands at appropriate abstraction levels, with effects propagated through memory rather than brittle prompt overrides. The environment integrates physiological survival costs, non-substitutable multi-tier production, an AMM-based price mechanism, and a gated education-occupation system. Using high-frequency transactions from the platforms mature phase, we find stable markets that reproduce key stylized facts (heavy-tailed returns and volatility clustering) and produce structured wealth stratification driven by education and access constraints. Ablations show simplified planners can match performance on narrow tasks, while the full architecture is more robust under multi-objective, long-horizon settings, supporting delayed investment and sustained exploration."}

The dynamic knowledge base with DCMD is added to the UGVs to: support enhanced situation awareness; improve autonomous decision making; and facilitate agility within complex and dynamic environments. As UGVs are heavily reliant on the a priori information added pre-mission, unexpected occurrences during a mission can cause identification ambiguities and require increased levels of user input. Updating this a priori information with contextual information can help UGVs realise their full potential. To address this, the dynamic knowledge base was designed using an ontology-driven representation, supported by near real-time information acquisition and analysis, to provide in-mission on-platform DCMD updates. This was implemented on a team of four UGVs that executed a laboratory based surveillance mission. The results showed that the ontology-driven dynamic representation of the UGV operational environment was machine actionable, producing contextual information to support a successful and timely mission, and contributed directly to the situation awareness."}

Unlike most previous studies, which focus primarily on algorithmic performance with respect to task completion, this article proposes a systematic set of general-purpose cooperation metrics aimed at characterizing not only efficiency, but also coordination and dependency between teams and agents, fairness, and sensitivity. These metrics are designed to be transferable to different multi-agent sequential domains similar to foraging. The proposed suite of metrics is structured into three main categories that jointly provide a multilevel characterization of cooperation: primary metrics, inter-team metrics, and intra-team metrics. They have been validated in a realistic destructive foraging scenario inspired by dynamic aquatic surface cleaning using heterogeneous autonomous vehicles. It involves two specialized teams with sequential dependencies: one focused on the search of resources, and another on their destruction. Several representative approaches have been evaluated, covering both learning-based algorithms and classical heuristic paradigms."}

We study two neural network-based agents that must communicate numerosities in a referential game using either discrete tokens or continuous sketches, thus exploring both symbolic and iconic representations. Without any pre-defined numeric concepts, the agents achieve high in-distribution communication accuracy in both communication channels and converge on high-precision symbol-meaning mappings. However, the emergent code is non-compositional: the agents fail to derive systematic messages for unseen numerosities, typically reusing the symbol of the highest trained numerosity (discrete), or collapsing extrapolated values onto a single sketch (continuous). We conclude that the communication pressure alone suffices for precise transmission of learned numerosities, but additional pressures are needed to yield compositional codes and generalisation abilities."}

Yet what constitutes a good workflow depends heavily on the task distribution and the available operators. Under domain shift, current systems typically rely on iterative workflow refinement to discover a feasible workflow from a large workflow space, incurring high iteration costs and yielding unstable, domain-specific behavior. In response, we internalize a decompose-recompose-decide mechanism into an open-source LLM for cross-domain workflow generation. To decompose, we learn a compact set of reusable workflow capabilities across diverse domains. To recompose, we map each input task to a sparse composition over these bases to generate a task-specific workflow in a single pass. To decide, we attribute the success or failure of workflow generation to counterfactual contributions from learned capabilities, thereby capturing which capabilities actually drive success by their marginal effects. Across stringent multi-domain, cross-domain, and unseen-domain evaluations, our 1-pass generator surpasses SOTA refinement baselines that consume 20 iterations, while substantially reducing generation latency and cost."}

However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Extensive evaluation of 38 LLMs reveals that even the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, and 84% of models exhibit performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, confirming pervasive data contamination risks. Error analysis further identifies contextual application-not factual knowledge-as the dominant bottleneck, with 35-48% of failures stemming from the inability to tailor medical knowledge to patient-specific constraints."}

Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS).

Our contributions are: (i) AgoraBench, a new benchmark spanning nine challenging settings (e.g., deception, monopoly) that supports diverse strategy modeling; (ii) human-aligned, economically grounded metrics derived from utility theory. This is operationalized via agent utility, negotiation power, and acquisition ratio that implicitly measure how well the negotiation aligns with human preference and (iii) a human preference grounded dataset with learning pipeline that strengthens LLMs' bargaining ability through both prompting and finetuning.

Recent work introduces dynamic vocabulary by sampling retrieved text spans but overlooks that the same sentence can be composed of spans of varying lengths, lacking explicit modeling of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) state space. This leads to restricted exploration of compositional paths and is biased toward the chosen path. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful for efficient exploring and generalizing over state spaces, particularly those with a DAG structure. However, prior GFlowNets-based language models operate at the token level and remain confined to tree-structured spaces, limiting their potential. In this work, we propose Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a principled GFlowNets framework for span generation. FoSS constructs a dynamic span vocabulary by segmenting the retrieved text flexibly, ensuring a DAG-structured state space, which allows GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths and improve generalization. With specialized reward models, FoSS generates diverse, high-quality text. Empirically, FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Scaling experiments further demonstrate FoSS benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora, retaining its advantage over strong baselines."}

Based on the learned symbolic model of states, NSAM learns action masks that rules out infeasible actions.

Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems. With all results, our study highlights the advancement of LRMs in formal reasoning (e.g., math, code) cannot be fully transferred to ToM, a typical task in social reasoning.

To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. We also validate HARPO against recent RL methods, where it achieves the most consistently strong performance across behavioral tasks."}

However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions. Extensive experiments on both offline and online datasets demonstrate that V-STAR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior accuracy and candidate-set diversity under strict latency constraints."}

A Study of Cultural Novelty in Recipe Generation", "comment": "14 pages, 12 figures, conference", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \\textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications."}

To address this, based on an analogy between the Dockerfile and the agentic task, we propose to employ agents to simulate and explore environment histories, guided by execution feedback. By tracing histories of a healthy environment, its state can be inverted to an earlier one with runtime failures, from which a task can be derived by packing the buggy state and the corresponding error messages. With our method, named CLI-Gym, a total of 1,655 environment-intensive tasks are derived, being the largest collection of its kind. Moreover, with curated successful trajectories, our fine-tuned model, named LiberCoder, achieves substantial absolute improvements of +21.1% (to 46.1%) on Terminal-Bench, outperforming various strong baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first public pipeline for scalable derivation of environment-intensive tasks."}

A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents. Despite their simplicity, these methods consistently improve performance, with the largest change being an increase in Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance from 33.3% to 47.7%. We release GameDevBench publicly to support further research into agentic game development."}

The dominant oversight paradigm, LLM-as-a-Judge, faces a fundamental dilemma: how can probabilistic systems reliably supervise other probabilistic systems without inheriting their failure modes? We argue that formal verification offers a principled escape from this dilemma, yet its adoption has been hindered by a critical bottleneck: the translation from natural language requirements to formal specifications. This paper bridges this gap by proposing , a neuro-symbolic framework that employs a bidirectional Formal-of-Thought architecture: LLMs serve as specification compilers that top-down decompose high-level human intent into atomic, verifiable constraints, then bottom-up prove compliance using Dafny specifications and Z3 Satisfiability modulo theories solving, which produces mathematical guarantees rather than probabilistic scores. We validate across three benchmarks spanning behavioral safety, multi-domain constraint adherence, and agentic upward deception detection. Experiments on 7 agent models demonstrate that achieves an average improvement of 16.6% over LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, enables weak-to-strong generalization where a 7B judge achieves over 90% accuracy detecting deception from 72B agents, and provides near-linear safety improvement through iterative refinement."}

To mitigate the tension between goal stability and reactive correctness, we introduce (i) a hierarchical branch-thinking planner that decomposes life goals into parallel objective branches and uses simulation-guided validation plus tiered re-planning to ensure feasibility; (ii) an adaptive agent profile with dual-process memory that separates short-term execution traces from long-term semantic consolidation, enabling persistent yet evolving identity; and (iii) a human-in-the-loop steering interface that injects long-horizon objectives and short commands at appropriate abstraction levels, with effects propagated through memory rather than brittle prompt overrides. The environment integrates physiological survival costs, non-substitutable multi-tier production, an AMM-based price mechanism, and a gated education-occupation system. Using high-frequency transactions from the platforms mature phase, we find stable markets that reproduce key stylized facts (heavy-tailed returns and volatility clustering) and produce structured wealth stratification driven by education and access constraints. Ablations show simplified planners can match performance on narrow tasks, while the full architecture is more robust under multi-objective, long-horizon settings, supporting delayed investment and sustained exploration."}

Yet what constitutes a good workflow depends heavily on the task distribution and the available operators. Under domain shift, current systems typically rely on iterative workflow refinement to discover a feasible workflow from a large workflow space, incurring high iteration costs and yielding unstable, domain-specific behavior. In response, we internalize a decompose-recompose-decide mechanism into an open-source LLM for cross-domain workflow generation. To decompose, we learn a compact set of reusable workflow capabilities across diverse domains. To recompose, we map each input task to a sparse composition over these bases to generate a task-specific workflow in a single pass. To decide, we attribute the success or failure of workflow generation to counterfactual contributions from learned capabilities, thereby capturing which capabilities actually drive success by their marginal effects. Across stringent multi-domain, cross-domain, and unseen-domain evaluations, our 1-pass generator surpasses SOTA refinement baselines that consume 20 iterations, while substantially reducing generation latency and cost."}
