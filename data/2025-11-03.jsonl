However, current trading agents primarily focus on single-step trading\ntasks and lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we\npropose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic\nmarket. To address this task, we develop a trading agent system, FinPos,\noptimized for position management. FinPos is able to interpret various types of\nmarket information from a professional perspective, providing a reliable basis\nfor positioning decisions. To mitigate the substantial market risks arising\nfrom position fluctuations, FinPos employs dual decision agents. Furthermore,\nthe continuous nature of position management necessitates our adoption of\nmulti-timescale rewards, which in turn empowers FinPos to effectively balance\nshort-term fluctuations against long-term trends. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the\nposition-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More\nimportantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a\nvast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making."}

However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics\nframeworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering\nlittle to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables\nprivacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks\nsupport for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable\nqueries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates\nLLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical\nmulti-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms\nthem into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first\ndecomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps\neach subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior\nstructural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent\nrewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and\nminimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by\nachieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive\nFA operations by a substantial margin.

In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which\nnaturally supports both representations. We train language models with\nbidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial\n(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data.

Users may\nprefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they\nvalue output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff\neffectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used\nfor a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing\nmethods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but\nthis requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately\nset the token budget for a query.

This approach eliminates\ndataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy\ntradeoff curves compared to standard methods.

(2) In Agenda RMs, states are\nassociated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3)\nCoupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.\nFurthermore, we introduce a new compositional learning algorithm that leverages\ncoupled RMs: Q-learning with coupled RMs (CoRM).

In many real-world\napplications, it is possible to distinguish between desirable and undesirable\nprocess executions, where desirable traces reflect efficient or compliant\nbehavior, and undesirable ones may involve inefficiencies, rule violations,\ndelays, or resource waste. This distinction presents an opportunity to guide\nprocess discovery in a more outcome-aware manner. Discovering a single process\nmodel without considering outcomes can yield representations poorly suited for\nconformance checking and performance analysis, as they fail to capture critical\nbehavioral differences. Moreover, prioritizing one behavior over the other may\nobscure structural distinctions vital for understanding process outcomes. By\nlearning interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features, we\ngroup traces with similar desirability profiles and apply process discovery\nseparately within each group.

In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of\npedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised\npedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,\ntwo with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across\nbehavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined\nmodel with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints\nlead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during\ncrossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual\nuncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more\ncautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this\ndata-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning\nmodel, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training\ndatasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by\nmodelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level\ndistributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on\npedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling.

BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL).
