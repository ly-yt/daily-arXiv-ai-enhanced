Existing\nmeasures of interpersonal dynamics, such as CRQA, correlation, Granger\ncausality, and transfer entropy, typically capture only a single dimension:\neither the synchrony/coordination or the direction of influence between\nindividuals. What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation\nthat unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We\npropose the context matrix as one such representation. The context matrix is\nthe transition matrix in a linear dynamical system, with entries specifying how\nmuch each individual's current behavior is attributable to their own versus\nevery other group member's past behaviors. Its values can be distilled into\npsychologically interpretable summary features of synchrony and directional\ninfluence. Evidence for the context matrix as psychologically meaningful is\nprovided in two steps. First, we develop a sequential Bayesian model that\ninfers context matrices from timeseries data and show that it accurately\nrecovers them in noisy simulations. Second, applying the model to human\neyetracking data, we show that summary features of the inferred context\nmatrices capture expected task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics (or\nlack thereof), predict task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and\nshow some correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality).\nWe conclude by situating the context matrix within a broader agenda for\nmodeling interpersonal dynamics."}

This\nevaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from\npotential collaborators, including historical performance and available\nresources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner\nindependently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data\nexchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in\nsignificant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD)\nmodel based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent\narchitecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful\ncomputational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to\nmultidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics\nextraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis.

NeurIPS 2024", "summary": "This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)\nframework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied\nagents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large\nLanguage Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently\nexploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context\nmemory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying\nenvironment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following\ntasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context\nmemory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently\nhandle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,\nwe implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating\nthe {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.\nCombined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not\nonly allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental\ncontext memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves\noverall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency\nrefinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of\nknowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and\nCARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied\ninstruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and\ntypes, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal\nsuccess rate and execution efficiency."}

Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align\nwith the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and\nhallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating\nfurther alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning\nand chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and\naction-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,\nand model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes\nThought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied\ndecision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based\noptimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step\nsample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning\nprocess, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by\nincorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes\nconsistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld\nenvironment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%\nimprovement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in\nmitigating model degradation after fine-tuning.
