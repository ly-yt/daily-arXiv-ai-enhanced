Yet, though prior work has shown LLMs to be\ncapable of identifying emotional connections and recognizing reciprocity in\ntrust games, little remains known about (i) how different strategies to build\ntrust compare, (ii) how such trust can be measured implicitly, and (iii) how\nthis relates to explicit measures of trust.\n  We study these questions by relating implicit measures of trust, i.e.\nsusceptibility to persuasion and propensity to collaborate financially, with\nexplicit measures of trust, i.e. a dyadic trust questionnaire well-established\nin psychology. We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically,\nby starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the\nLLMs' system prompt. Surprisingly, we find that the measures of explicit trust\nare either little or highly negatively correlated with implicit trust measures.\nThese findings suggest that measuring trust between LLMs by asking their\nopinion may be deceiving.

In line with such an\nevolution, AgentScope introduces major improvements in a new version (1.0),\ntowards comprehensively supporting flexible and efficient tool-based\nagent-environment interactions for building agentic applications. Specifically,\nwe abstract foundational components essential for agentic applications and\nprovide unified interfaces and extensible modules, enabling developers to\neasily leverage the latest progress, such as new models and MCPs. Furthermore,\nwe ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm and offer advanced agent-level\ninfrastructure based on a systematic asynchronous design, which enriches both\nhuman-agent and agent-agent interaction patterns while improving execution\nefficiency. Building on this foundation, we integrate several built-in agents\ntailored to specific practical scenarios. AgentScope also includes robust\nengineering support for developer-friendly experiences. We provide a scalable\nevaluation module with a visual studio interface, making the development of\nlong-trajectory agentic applications more manageable and easier to trace. In\naddition, AgentScope offers a runtime sandbox to ensure safe agent execution\nand facilitates rapid deployment in production environments. With these\nenhancements, AgentScope provides a practical foundation for building scalable,\nadaptive, and effective agentic applications."}

Teaching Vision-Language-Action Models to Reject the Impossible", "comment": "9 pages, 2 figures, 1 table", "summary": "Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong\nperformance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal\ninputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in\npredicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when\nthe requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs\ncan recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural\nlanguage commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the\nenvironment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that\n(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)\nengages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds\nplausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct\na large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and\ntrain a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our\napproach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing\npaired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and\nnatural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false\npremise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing\nsuccessful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%."}

Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often\nneglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading\nto limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping\noverhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that\nintegrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline.

First, causal discovery learns a\nBayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the\noptimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based\nclassifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection\nmatches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing\ninput selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing\nonly on causally relevant features."}

Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for\nreal-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes\nwithout requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when\ndownstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL\napproaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs\nduring incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by\ndevising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the\nzero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding\nRecomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple\ntextual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a\nfoundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub\nand compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that\nimproves classification.

Bridging this gap often requires\nguiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic\nconstraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability\nacross various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform\nneuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline\nadopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating\nbasic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of\nlogical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second\nstage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and\ninnovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization\nalgorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical\nconsistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the\ndiffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical\nsymbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and\npreference learning.

The competitor definition is investor-specific, and\ndata is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched\nby indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.\nAlthough considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI\nsystems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and\nthere is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of\nevaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,\nunstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured\nevaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized\nattributes.

Yet, though prior work has shown LLMs to be\ncapable of identifying emotional connections and recognizing reciprocity in\ntrust games, little remains known about (i) how different strategies to build\ntrust compare, (ii) how such trust can be measured implicitly, and (iii) how\nthis relates to explicit measures of trust.\n  We study these questions by relating implicit measures of trust, i.e.\nsusceptibility to persuasion and propensity to collaborate financially, with\nexplicit measures of trust, i.e. a dyadic trust questionnaire well-established\nin psychology. We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically,\nby starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the\nLLMs' system prompt. Surprisingly, we find that the measures of explicit trust\nare either little or highly negatively correlated with implicit trust measures.\nThese findings suggest that measuring trust between LLMs by asking their\nopinion may be deceiving. Instead, context-specific and implicit measures may\nbe more informative in understanding how LLMs trust each other."}
