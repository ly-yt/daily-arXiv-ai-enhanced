However, most frameworks are homogeneous, where all agents share the same base LLM and differ only in prompts, tools, and positions in the workflow. This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow. Building on this finding, we propose \\textbf{OneFlow}, an algorithm that automatically tailors workflows for single-agent execution, reducing inference costs compared to existing automatic multi-agent design frameworks without trading off accuracy. These results position the single-LLM implementation of multi-agent workflows as a strong baseline for MAS research. We also note that single-LLM methods cannot capture heterogeneous workflows due to the lack of KV cache sharing across different LLMs, highlighting future opportunities in developing \\textit{truly} heterogeneous multi-agent systems."}

SF allows agents to operate over scoped views of shared memory, propose structured updates, and maintain global coherence through local ontology-based validation and refresh without centralized control or explicit message passing. The central theoretical result is a bisimulation theorem showing that each agent's local execution is behaviorally equivalent to its projection of the global semantics, in both deterministic and probabilistic settings. This enables safety, liveness, and temporal properties to be verified locally and soundly lifted to the full system. SF supports agents whose update proposals vary across invocations, including those generated by learned or heuristic components, provided updates pass semantic validation before integration. We establish deterministic and probabilistic guarantees ensuring semantic alignment under asynchronous or degraded communication. To validate the model operationally, we implement a lightweight reference architecture that instantiates its core mechanisms. A 250-agent simulation evaluates these properties across over 11,000 validated updates, demonstrating convergence under probabilistic refresh, bounded communication, and resilience to agent failure. Together, these results show that Semantic Fusion can provide a formal and scalable basis for verifiable autonomy in decentralized systems."}

Communication further enables efficient cooperation among all agents interacting in an environment. This work aims at providing an overview of communication techniques in multi-agent reinforcement learning. By an in-depth analysis of 29 publications on this topic, the strengths and weaknesses of explicit, implicit, attention-based, graph-based, and hierarchical/role-based communication are evaluated. The results of this comparison show that there is no general, optimal communication framework for every problem. On the contrary, the choice of communication depends heavily on the problem at hand. The comparison also highlights the importance of communication methods with low computational overhead to enable scalability to environments where many agents interact. Finally, the paper discusses current research gaps, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarking of system-level metrics and improved robustness under realistic communication conditions to enhance the real-world applicability of these approaches."}

Due to their impressive recall abilities, large language models (LLMs) have been recently explored for differential diagnosis. Existing approaches to evaluating LLM-based rare disease diagnosis suffer from two critical limitations: they rely on idealized clinical case studies that fail to capture real-world clinical complexity, or they use ICD codes as disease labels, which significantly undercounts rare diseases since many lack direct mappings to comprehensive rare disease databases like Orphanet. To address these limitations, we explore MIMIC-RD, a rare disease differential diagnosis benchmark constructed by directly mapping clinical text entities to Orphanet. Our methodology involved an initial LLM-based mining process followed by validation from four medical annotators to confirm identified entities were genuine rare diseases. We evaluated various models on our dataset of 145 patients and found that current state-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly on rare disease differential diagnosis, highlighting the substantial gap between existing capabilities and clinical needs. From our findings, we outline several future steps towards improving differential diagnosis of rare diseases."}

As MAS become increasingly deployed in web services (e.g., search engines), designing adaptive topologies for diverse cross-domain user queries becomes essential. Current graph learning-based design methodologies often adhere to a \"one-for-one\" paradigm, where a specialized model is trained for each specific task domain. This approach suffers from poor generalization to unseen domains and fails to leverage shared structural knowledge across different tasks. To address this, we propose OFA-TAD, a one-for-all framework that generates adaptive collaboration graphs for any task described in natural language through a single universal model. Our approach integrates a Task-Aware Graph State Encoder (TAGSE) that filters task-relevant node information via sparse gating, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically selects specialized sub-networks to drive node and edge prediction. We employ a three-stage training strategy: unconditional pre-training on canonical topologies for structural priors, large-scale conditional pre-training on LLM-generated datasets for task-topology mappings, and supervised fine-tuning on empirically validated graphs. Experiments across six diverse benchmarks show that OFA-TAD significantly outperforms specialized one-for-one models, generating highly adaptive MAS topologies.

Most deployed artificial systems realise their functions via sequential or time-multiplexed updates. Conscious experience appears unified and simultaneous. I show that this difference matters formally. I augment Stack Theory with algebraic laws relating within time-window constraint satisfaction to conjunction. I introduce a precise temporal semantics over windowed trajectories $τ^{Δ,s}$ and prove that existential temporal realisation $\\Diamond_Δ$ does not preserve conjunction. A system can realise all the ingredients of experience across time without ever instantiating the experienced conjunction itself. I then distinguish two postulates. StrongSync requires objective co-instantiation of the grounded conjunction within the window, while WeakSync permits temporal ``smearing''. I formalise concurrency-capacity to measure what is needed to satisfy StrongSync. Finally, I review neurophysiological evidence suggesting that consciousness depends on phase synchrony and effective connectivity, and that loss of consciousness is often associated with its breakdown. This evidence makes WeakSync less plausible. Under StrongSync, software consciousness on strictly sequential substrates is impossible for contents whose grounding requires two or more simultaneous contributors. The more parts from which simultaneous contribution required, the more concurrency capacity is required. The hardware matters. Consciousness attribution therefore requires architectural inspection, not just functional performance."}

Most interpretability approaches emphasise static representations or causal interventions, leaving temporal structure largely unexplored. Drawing on neuroscience, where temporal integration and metastability are core markers of neural organisation, we adapt these concepts to transformer models and discuss a composite dynamical metric, computed from activation time-series during autoregressive generation. We evaluate this metric in GPT-2-medium across five conditions: structured reasoning, forced repetition, high-temperature noisy sampling, attention-head pruning, and weight-noise injection. Structured reasoning consistently exhibits elevated metric relative to repetitive, noisy, and perturbed regimes, with statistically significant differences confirmed by one-way ANOVA and large effect sizes in key comparisons. These results are robust to layer selection, channel subsampling, and random seeds. Our findings demonstrate that neuroscience-inspired dynamical metrics can reliably characterise differences in computational organisation across functional regimes in large language models. We stress that the proposed metric captures formal dynamical properties and does not imply subjective experience."}

Another primary contribution of this work is the in-depth technical delineation of two complementary communication protocols - the Model Context Protocol, which standardizes how agents access external tools and contextual data, and the Agent2Agent protocol, which governs peer coordination, negotiation, and delegation.

We define explanation driftas the epoch-to-epoch change in normalized token attributions on a fixed probe set, and introduce the Reasoning Stabilization Point(RSP), the earliest epoch after which drift remains consistently low. RSP is computed from within-run drift dynamics and requires no tuning on out-of-distribution data. Across multiple lightweight transformer classifiers and benchmark classification tasks, drift typically collapses into a low, stable regime early in training, while validation accuracy continues to change only marginally. In a controlled shortcut setting with label-correlated trigger tokens, attribution dynamics expose increasing reliance on the shortcut even when validation accuracy remains competitive. Overall, explanation drift provides a simple, low-cost diagnostic for monitoring how decision evidence evolves during fine-tuning and for selecting checkpoints in a stable-evidence regime."}

This shift already supports the automation of complex workflows in software engineering, scientific discovery, and web navigation, yet the variety of emerging designs, from simple single loop agents to hierarchical multi agent systems, makes the landscape hard to navigate.

We address this problem of stylistically improving designs based on natural language instructions. While VLMs have shown initial success in graphic design, their pretrained knowledge on styles is often too general and misaligned with specific domain data. For example, VLMs may associate minimalism with abstract designs, whereas designers emphasize shape and color choices. Our key insight is to leverage design data -- a collection of real-world designs that implicitly capture designer's principles -- to learn design knowledge and guide stylistic improvement. We propose PRISM (PRior-Informed Stylistic Modification) that constructs and applies a design knowledge base through three stages: (1) clustering high-variance designs to capture diversity within a style, (2) summarizing each cluster into actionable design knowledge, and (3) retrieving relevant knowledge during inference to enable style-aware improvement. Experiments on the Crello dataset show that PRISM achieves the highest average rank of 1.49 (closer to 1 is better) over baselines in style alignment. User studies further validate these results, showing that PRISM is consistently preferred by designers."}

The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency. These results indicate that observability-aware evaluation can reveal non-monotonic effects within multi-agent pipelines and that memory-augmented agents can jointly maximize security robustness, real-time performance, operational cost savings, and environmental sustainability without modifying underlying model weights, providing a production-ready pathway for secure and green LLM deployments."}

In this paper, we propose the task of innovative math problem generation (IMPG). To solve the IMPG task, this paper proposes a self-evolving, multi-role collaborative framework with fine-grained difficulty guidance. First, a multi-role collaborative mechanism comprising a sampler, generator, evaluator, state machine, and memory is constructed, ensuring the correctness of generated problems through iterative optimization informed by self-assessment and external feedback. Second, we introduce an improved difficulty model to quantify difficulty and provide fine-grained guidance. We adopt the data-driven association-guided path sampling (DAPS) algorithm to enhance the semantic rationality of sampled encodings. Third, we construct the HSM3K-CN dataset, which comprises high-quality high school math problems. A multi-stage training pipeline is adopted, incorporating continual pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), to enhance the generation and evaluation capabilities of the base model. Finally, system self-evolution is achieved by transferring evaluation capabilities from the expert model to the apprentice model via distillation.

To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid multi-agent lane change decision model aimed at increasing CAV participation in cooperative platooning and maximizing its associated benefits. The proposed model employs the QMIX framework, integrating traffic data processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN-QMIX). This architecture addresses a critical issue in dynamic traffic scenarios by enabling CAVs to make optimal decisions irrespective of the varying number of CAVs present in mixed traffic. Additionally, a trajectory planner and a model predictive controller are designed to ensure smooth and safe lane-change execution. The proposed model is trained and evaluated within a microsimulation environment under varying CAV market penetration rates.

Unlike prior approaches that use formal methods primarily to validate LLM outputs, CodeLogician uses LLMs to construct explicit formal models of software systems, enabling automated reasoning to answer rich semantic questions beyond binary verification outcomes.\n  To rigorously evaluate mathematical reasoning about software logic, we introduce code-logic-bench, a benchmark targeting the middle ground between theorem proving and software engineering benchmarks. It measures reasoning correctness about program state spaces, control flow, coverage constraints, and edge cases, with ground truth defined via formal modeling and region decomposition.\n  Comparing LLM-only reasoning against LLMs augmented with CodeLogician, formal augmentation yields substantial improvements, closing a 41-47 percentage point gap in reasoning accuracy.

Previous version with human-AI collaboration: arXiv:2410.14640", "summary": "We introduce a unified framework that seamlessly integrates algorithmic recourse, contextual bandits, and large language models (LLMs) to support sequential decision-making in high-stakes settings such as personalized medicine. We first introduce the recourse bandit problem, where a decision-maker must select both a treatment action and a feasible, minimal modification to mutable patient features. To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model-Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only $O(\\log^2 T)$ times, where $T$ is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real hypertension-management case study confirm that GLRB and LIBRA improve regret, treatment quality, and sample efficiency compared with standard contextual bandits and LLM-only benchmarks. Our results highlight the promise of recourse-aware, LLM-assisted bandit algorithms for trustworthy LLM-bandits collaboration in personalized high-stakes decision-making."}

On a curated subset of DAPO-MATH, 89\\% of failures exhibit such traps. To solve this problem, we introduce TAAR (Trap-Aware Adaptive Restart), a test-time control framework that trains a diagnostic policy to predict two signals from partial trajectories: a trap index for where to truncate and an escape probability for whether and how strongly to intervene. At inference time, TAAR truncates the trajectory before the predicted trap segment and adaptively restarts decoding; for severely trapped cases, it applies stronger perturbations, including higher-temperature resampling and an optional structured reboot suffix. Experiments on challenging mathematical and scientific reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, AIME25, GPQA-Diamond, HMMT25, BRUMO25) show that TAAR improves reasoning performance without fine-tuning base model parameters."}

Inspired by educational psychology, MARS mimics human learning by integrating principle-based reflection (abstracting normative rules to avoid errors) and procedural reflection (deriving step-by-step strategies for success). By synthesizing these insights into optimized instructions, MARS allows agents to systematically refine their reasoning logic without continuous online feedback.

However, its potential for enhancing tasks that demand step-by-step logical deduction, such as mathematical reasoning, remains underexplored. A core limitation of existing ICL approaches is their static use of demonstrations: examples are pre-selected before inference and remain fixed, failing to adapt to the dynamic confusion points that often arise during multi-step reasoning such as ambiguous calculations or logical gaps. These unresolved confusion points can lead to cascading errors that degrade final accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose Process In-Context Learning (PICL), a dynamic demonstration integration framework designed to boost mathematical reasoning by responding to real-time inference needs. PICL operates in two stages: 1)~it identifies potential confusion points by analyzing semantics and entropy in the reasoning process and summarizes their core characteristics; 2)~upon encountering these points, it retrieves relevant demonstrations from the demonstration pool that match the confusion context and inserts them directly into the ongoing reasoning process to guide subsequent steps. Experiments show that PICL outperforms baseline methods by mitigating mid-inference confusion, highlighting the value of adaptive demonstration insertion in complex mathematical reasoning."}

Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. Our work moves beyond restrictive assumptions on system dynamics and uncertainty, as demonstrated on two case studies including a black-box system with a neural network controller."}

Benchmarking Structural Correctness-Sustainability Trade-offs in Novel Structured Output Formats", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly required to generate structured, machine-readable outputs for downstream systems. While recent benchmarks have focused on evaluating the structural correctness of such outputs, the environmental impact of inference for different output formats has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we argue that structured output formats should be assessed not only in terms of correctness, but also with respect to their environmental efficiency. To this end, we introduce a sustainability-aware evaluation framework for structured generation that measures token usage, generation time, and estimated carbon emissions. Within this framework, we propose the Environment-Aware Generation Correctness Score (GCS_env), a unified metric that integrates structural correctness with carbon-aware efficiency. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark the novel TOON format against established representations (JSON, XML, YAML) across multiple LLMs spanning different architectures and parameter scales.\n  Our results reveal a consistent trade-off: TOON yields markedly more compact outputs and lower emissions, but lower structural correctness when models lack native support. We show that increased model capacity reduces this gap and that environment-aware scoring can shift format rankings depending on deployment priorities. highlighting the need for sustainability-inclusive benchmarking and provides empirical evidence that compact representations such as TOON can offer practical advantages in large-scale, carbon-conscious LLM deployments."}

The framework integrates four components: clustering to select representative reviews, generation of advices, iterative evaluation, and feasibility based ranking. This design couples corpus distillation with feedback driven advice refinement to produce outputs that are specific, actionable, and practical.

This degradation, known as context rot, reflects a failure to maintain coherent and task-relevant internal states over extended reasoning horizons. Existing approaches primarily manage context through raw accumulation or passive summarization, treating it as a static artifact and allowing early errors or misplaced emphasis to persist. Motivated by this perspective, we propose ARC, which is the first framework to systematically formulate context management as an active, reflection-driven process that treats context as a dynamic internal reasoning state during execution. ARC operationalizes this view through reflection-driven monitoring and revision, allowing agents to actively reorganize their working context when misalignment or degradation is detected. Experiments on challenging long-horizon information-seeking benchmarks show that ARC consistently outperforms passive context compression methods, achieving up to an 11% absolute improvement in accuracy on BrowseComp-ZH with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct."}

Existing extensions, including bipolar argumentation frameworks, introduce support relations, but these do not capture the asymmetric and constitutive nature of subarguments or their interaction with attacks. In this paper, we study abstract argumentation frameworks enriched with an explicit subargument relation, treated alongside attack as a basic relation. We analyse how subargument relations interact with attacks and examine their impact on fundamental semantic properties. This framework provides a principled abstraction of structural information and clarifies the role of subarguments in abstract acceptability reasoning."}

PREGU monitors the entropy of the output distribution during autoregressive generation and halts the process whenever entropy exceeds a defined threshold, signaling uncertainty. From that point, a localized search is performed in the latent space to refine the partial reasoning and select the most coherent answer, using the Soft Reasoning method. Experiments conducted with LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2-7B across four reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, GSM-Hard, SVAMP, and StrategyQA) showed performance greater than or similar to Soft Reasoning, indicating that entropy can serve as an effective signal to trigger selective refinement during reasoning."}

To address these limitations, we propose UniMo, a novel framework that integrates motion-language information and interpretable chain of thought (CoT) reasoning into the LLM via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We further introduce reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a post-training strategy that optimizes over groups of tokens to enforce structural correctness and semantic alignment, mitigating cumulative errors in motion token prediction.

The taxonomy comprises 129 fine-grained atomic risk categories spanning technical, legal, societal, and ethical dimensions, grounded in real-world driving regulations and safety principles and reviewed by domain experts.

Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf ) provides a robust formalism for encoding these temporal goals. Traditional LTLf task planning approaches often transform the temporal planning problem into a classical planning problem with reachability goals, which are then solved using off-the-shelf planners. However, these methods often lack informed heuristics to provide a guided search for temporal goals. We introduce TIDE (Trace-Informed Depth-first Exploration), a novel approach that addresses this limitation by decomposing a temporal problem into a sequence of smaller, manageable reach-avoid sub-problems, each solvable using an off-the-shelf planner. TIDE identifies and prioritizes promising automaton traces within the domain graph, using cost-driven heuristics to guide exploration. Its adaptive backtracking mechanism systematically recovers from failed plans by recalculating costs and penalizing infeasible transitions, ensuring completeness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TIDE achieves promising performance and is a valuable addition to the portfolio of planning methods for temporally extended goals."}

The NOMA addresses this need by power multiplexing, allowing multiple users to access the network simultaneously. Nevertheless, the NOMA system has few limitations.

This leads to two major challenges: the lack of manual annotations for model adaptation and the difficulty for pretrained models to stay up-to-date with domain-specific facts. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong zero-shot abilities, they still suffer from hallucination and limited domain grounding. In contrast, discriminative Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) provide reliable grounding but require costly annotations to cover new domains. We introduce Docs2Synth, a synthetic-supervision framework that enables retrieval-guided inference for private and low-resource domains. Docs2Synth automatically processes raw document collections, generates and verifies diverse QA pairs via an agent-based system, and trains a lightweight visual retriever to extract domain-relevant evidence. During inference, the retriever collaborates with an MLLM through an iterative retrieval--generation loop, reducing hallucination and improving response consistency. We further deliver Docs2Synth as an easy-to-use Python package, enabling plug-and-play deployment across diverse real-world scenarios. Experiments on multiple VRDU benchmarks show that Docs2Synth substantially enhances grounding and domain generalization without requiring human annotations."}

In this paper, we introduce ToolPRMBench, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate PRMs for tool-using agents. ToolPRMBench is built on top of several representative tool-using benchmarks and converts agent trajectories into step-level test cases. Each case contains the interaction history, a correct action, a plausible but incorrect alternative, and relevant tool metadata. We respectively utilize offline sampling to isolate local single-step errors and online sampling to capture realistic multi-step failures from full agent rollouts. A multi-LLM verification pipeline is proposed to reduce label noise and ensure data quality. We conduct extensive experiments across large language models, general PRMs, and tool-specialized PRMs on ToolPRMBench.

This paper provides a proof-of-concept system architecture for stable self-training under sparse external feedback and bounded memory, and empirically characterises its learning dynamics and failure modes.\n  We introduce a self-training architecture in which learning is mediated exclusively by environmental viability, rather than by reward, objective functions, or externally defined fitness criteria. Candidate behaviours are executed under real resource constraints, and only those whose environmental effects both persist and preserve the possibility of future interaction are propagated. The environment does not provide semantic feedback, dense rewards, or task-specific supervision; selection operates solely through differential survival of behaviours as world-altering events, making proxy optimisation impossible and rendering reward-hacking evolutionarily unstable.\n  Analysis of semantic dynamics shows that improvement arises primarily through the persistence of effective and repeatable strategies under a regime of consolidation and pruning, a paradigm we refer to as negative-space learning (NSL), and that models develop meta-learning strategies (such as deliberate experimental failure in order to elicit informative error messages) without explicit instruction. This work establishes that environment-grounded selection enables sustainable open-ended self-improvement, offering a viable path toward more robust and generalisable autonomous systems without reliance on human-curated data or complex reward shaping."}

Data generation is redefined as supervisory signal production, and a novel taxonomy is introduced based on the \"availability of data and labels.\" This framework organizes methodologies into four resource-centric paradigms: Data Augmentation, Data Generation from Scratch, Automated Data Annotation, and Self-Supervised Signal Construction. Furthermore, a multi-level evaluation framework is established to integrate intrinsic quality and extrinsic utility, compiling performance gains across diverse DI benchmarks. Guided by this unified structure, the methodological landscape is dissected to reveal critical challenges such as fidelity gaps and frontiers including co-evolutionary ecosystems. Ultimately, by systematizing this fragmented field, data generation is positioned as the central engine for next-generation DI."}

However, existing large language model training methods primarily allow models to learn from existing textual content or solve predetermined problems, lacking experience in real scenarios involving interaction, negotiation, and competition with others. To address this, this paper proposes Multi-Agent Reward Optimization (MARO), a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire stronger reasoning abilities by learning and practicing in multi-agent social environments. Specifically, MARO first addresses the sparse learning signal problem by decomposing final success or failure outcomes into each specific behavior during the interaction process; second, it handles the uneven role distribution problem by balancing the training sample weights of different roles; finally, it addresses environmental instability issues by directly evaluating the utility of each behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that MARO not only achieves significant improvements in social reasoning capabilities, but also that the abilities acquired through social simulation learning can effectively transfer to other tasks such as mathematical reasoning and instruction following. This reveals the tremendous potential of multi-agent social learning in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs."}

We propose a modular two-LLM framework in which an Issue model extracts salient issues and assigns coarse themes, and an Advice model generates targeted operational fixes conditioned on the extracted issue representation. To enable specialization without expensive full fine-tuning, we adapt the Advice model using a mixture of LoRA experts strategy: multiple low-rank adapters are trained and a lightweight gating mechanism performs token-level expert mixing at inference, combining complementary expertise across issue types. We construct synthetic review-issue-advice triples from Yelp reviews (airlines and restaurants) to supervise training, and evaluate recommendations using an eight dimension operational rubric spanning actionability, specificity, feasibility, expected impact, novelty, non-redundancy, bias, and clarity. Across both domains, our approach consistently outperforms prompting-only and single-adapter baselines, yielding higher actionability and specificity while retaining favorable efficiency-quality trade-offs."}

To bridge these gaps, we propose PsychēChat, which explicitly integrates emotion shift tracking and safety risk analysis for psychological counseling. Specifically, we employ interactive role-playing to synthesize counselor--seeker dialogues, incorporating two modules: Emotion Management Module, to capture seekers' current emotions and emotion shifts; and Risk Control Module, to anticipate seekers' subsequent reactions and identify potential risks. Furthermore, we introduce two modeling paradigms. The Agent Mode structures emotion management, risk control, and counselor responses into a collaborative multi-agent pipeline. The LLM Mode integrates these stages into a unified chain-of-thought for end-to-end inference, balancing efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments, including interactive scoring, dialogue-level evaluation, and human assessment, demonstrate that PsychēChat outperforms existing methods for emotional insight and safety control."}

We design two tasks to test (1) if LLMs can detect when story characters, through their actions, demonstrate knowledge they should not possess, and (2) if LLMs can predict story characters' next actions based on their own knowledge vs. objective truths they do not know.

Whether these failures stem from an inability to locate evidence (recognition failure) or integrate it (synthesis failure) is unclear. We introduce Multi-Focus Attention Instruction (MFAI), a semantic probe to disentangle these mechanisms by explicitly steering attention towards selected positions. Across 5 LLMs on two multi-hop QA tasks (MuSiQue and NeoQA), we establish the \"Weakest Link Law\": multi-hop reasoning performance collapses to the performance level of the least visible evidence. Crucially, this failure is governed by absolute position rather than the linear distance between facts (performance variance $<3%$). We further identify a duality in attention steering: while matched MFAI resolves recognition bottlenecks, improving accuracy by up to 11.5% in low-visibility positions, misleading MFAI triggers confusion in real-world tasks but is successfully filtered in synthetic tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that \"thinking\" models that utilize System-2 reasoning, effectively locate and integrate the required information, matching gold-only baselines even in noisy, long-context settings."}

Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment."}

We consolidate 38 public meme datasets, filter and map dataset-specific labels into a shared taxonomy of $20$ tasks spanning harm, targets, figurative/pragmatic intent, and affect.

Clinicians interleave information gathering with irreversible actions, guided by regret, constraints and patient values. We argue that the dominant computational substrate of clinician reasoning is not cardinal optimization but ordinal, non-compensatory decision-making: Clinicians frequently rely on fast-and-frugal, lexicographic heuristics (e.g., fast-and-frugal trees) that stop early after checking a small, fixed sequence of cues. We provide a normative rationale for why such algorithms are not merely bounded rationality shortcuts, but can be epistemically preferred in medicine. First, many clinical trade-offs are constructed through human judgment and are only weakly measurable on absolute scales; without strong measurement axioms, only orderings are invariant, motivating an ordinal-by-default stance. Second, preference and signal elicitation are structurally crude: The mapping from truth $\\to$ perception $\\to$ inference $\\to$ recorded variables introduces layered noise, leaving a persistent uncertainty floor. When this 'crudeness' overwhelms the decision margin, plug-in expected-utility optimization becomes brittle (high flip probability under small perturbations), whereas robust dominance/filtering rules ($ε$-dominance, maximin) stabilize decisions.Finally, we outline a clinician-aligned AI blueprint: Use rich models for beliefs and trajectories, but choose actions through robust ordinal rules; treat heuristics as the low-dimensional special case; and deploy AI as 'selective complexity' -- invoked mainly for tie-breaking when decisions are fragile and information has positive expected impact."}

This shift already supports the automation of complex workflows in software engineering, scientific discovery, and web navigation, yet the variety of emerging designs, from simple single loop agents to hierarchical multi agent systems, makes the landscape hard to navigate.

To enable non-experts to translate intuitive design intent into manufacturable artifacts, recent large language models-based text-to-CAD efforts focus on command sequences or script-based formats like CadQuery. However, these formats are kernel-dependent and lack universality for manufacturing. In contrast, the Standard for the Exchange of Product Data (STEP, ISO 10303) file is a widely adopted, neutral boundary representation (B-rep) format directly compatible with manufacturing, but its graph-structured, cross-referenced nature poses unique challenges for auto-regressive LLMs. To address this, we curate a dataset of ~40K STEP-caption pairs and introduce novel preprocessing tailored for the graph-structured format of STEP, including a depth-first search-based reserialization that linearizes cross-references while preserving locality and chain-of-thought(CoT)-style structural annotations that guide global coherence. We integrate retrieval-augmented generation to ground predictions in relevant examples for supervised fine-tuning, and refine generation quality through reinforcement learning with a specific Chamfer Distance-based geometric reward. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains of our STEP-LLM in geometric fidelity over the Text2CAD baseline, with improvements arising from multiple stages of our framework: the RAG module substantially enhances completeness and renderability, the DFS-based reserialization strengthens overall accuracy, and the RL further reduces geometric discrepancy.

Therefore, to adapt the health management in the SMC era, this work proposes a principle of aligning underlying capabilities (AUC principle) and develops SpaceHMchat, an open-source Human-AI collaboration (HAIC) framework for all-in-loop health management (AIL HM). SpaceHMchat serves across the entire loop of work condition recognition, anomaly detection, fault localization, and maintenance decision making, achieving goals such as conversational task completion, adaptive human-in-the-loop learning, personnel structure optimization, knowledge sharing, efficiency enhancement, as well as transparent reasoning and improved interpretability. Meanwhile, to validate this exploration, a hardware-realistic fault injection experimental platform is established, and its simulation model is built and open-sourced, both fully replicating the real SPS. The corresponding experimental results demonstrate that SpaceHMchat achieves excellent performance across 23 quantitative metrics, such as 100% conclusion accuracy in logical reasoning of work condition recognition, over 99% success rate in anomaly detection tool invocation, over 90% precision in fault localization, and knowledge base search time under 3 minutes in maintenance decision-making.

Specifically, we present a unified monitoring signal and a reward-based classifier to decide when to employ LoRA for deeper factual reconstruction and when to apply TextGrad for token-level edits. Our approach remains memory-efficient by offloading the symbolic transformations to an external LLM only when needed. Additionally, the refined prompts produced during symbolic editing serve as high-quality, reusable training data, an important benefit in data-scarce domains like mathematical reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM backbones show that neurosymbolic LoRA consistently outperforms purely numerical or purely symbolic baselines, demonstrating superior adaptability and improved performance. Our findings highlight the value of interleaving numerical and symbolic updates to unlock a new level of versatility in language model fine-tuning."}

However, not all reflections are beneficial-many are superficial, offering little to no improvement over the original answer and incurring computation overhead. In this paper, we identify and address the problem of superficial reflection in LRMs. We first propose Self-Critique Fine-Tuning (SCFT), a training framework that enhances the model's reflective reasoning ability using only self-generated critiques. SCFT prompts models to critique their own outputs, filters high-quality critiques through rejection sampling, and fine-tunes the model using a critique-based objective. Building on this strong foundation, we further introduce Reinforcement Learning with Effective Reflection Rewards (RLERR). RLERR leverages the high-quality reflections initialized by SCFT to construct reward signals, guiding the model to internalize the self-correction process via reinforcement learning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, AIME2024 and AIME2025, show that SCFT and RLERR significantly improve both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

While recent work demonstrates that large language models can automate configuration tasks, a distinct class of intents requires generating optimization code to compute provably optimal solutions for traffic engineering, routing, and resource allocation. Current systems assume text-based intent expression, requiring operators to enumerate topologies and parameters in prose. Network practitioners naturally reason about structure through diagrams, yet whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process annotated network sketches into correct optimization code remains unexplored. We present IntentOpt, a benchmark of 85 optimization problems across 17 categories, evaluating four VLMs (GPT-5-Mini, Claude-Haiku-4.5, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision) under three prompting strategies on multimodal versus text-only inputs. Our evaluation shows that visual parameter extraction reduces execution success by 12-21 percentage points (pp), with GPT-5-Mini dropping from 93% to 72%. Program-of-thought prompting decreases performance by up to 13 pp, and open-source models lag behind closed-source ones, with Llama-3.2-11B-Vision reaching 18% compared to 75% for GPT-5-Mini. These results establish baseline capabilities and limitations of current VLMs for optimization code generation within an IBN system.

Recent neuro-symbolic REC approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to perform compositional reasoning, decomposing queries 4 structured programs and executing them step-by-step. While such approaches achieve interpretable reasoning and strong zero-shot generalization, they assume that intermediate reasoning steps are accurate. However, this assumption causes cascading errors: false detections and invalid relations propagate through the reasoning chain, yielding high-confidence false positives even when no target is present in the image. To address this limitation, we introduce Verification-Integrated Reasoning Operators (VIRO), a neuro-symbolic framework that embeds lightweight operator-level verifiers within reasoning steps. Each operator executes and validates its output, such as object existence or spatial relationship, thereby allowing the system to robustly handle no-target cases when verification conditions are not met. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 61.1% balanced accuracy across target-present and no-target settings, and demonstrates generalization to real-world egocentric data.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1x1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model's internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness. Overall, SL-CBM bridges the gap between concept-based reasoning and spatial explainability, setting a new standard for interpretable and trustworthy concept-based models."}

This autonomy introduces serious security risks: malicious instructions or visual prompt injections can trigger unsafe reasoning and cause harmful system-level actions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based blocking, prevent damage but often abort tasks prematurely, reducing agent utility. In this paper, we present MirrorGuard, a plug-and-play defense framework that uses simulation-based training to improve CUA security in the real world. To reduce the cost of large-scale training in operating systems, we propose a novel neural-symbolic simulation pipeline, which generates realistic, high-risk GUI interaction trajectories entirely in a text-based simulated environment, which captures unsafe reasoning patterns and potential system hazards without executing real operations. In the simulation environment, MirrorGuard learns to intercept and rectify insecure reasoning chains of CUAs before they produce and execute unsafe actions. In real-world testing, extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and CUA architectures show that MirrorGuard significantly mitigates security risks. For instance, on the ByteDance UI-TARS system, it reduces the unsafe rate from 66.5% to 13.0% while maintaining a marginal false refusal rate (FRR). In contrast, the state-of-the-art GuardAgent only achieves a reduction to 53.9% and suffers from a 15.4% higher FRR. Our work proves that simulation-derived defenses can provide robust, real-world protection while maintaining the fundamental utility of the agent.

SCULPT scores and prunes actions using a combination of symbolic checks (dimensional consistency, type compatibility, magnitude sanity, depth control, and diversity) and structural pattern guidance, thereby steering the search toward plausible reasoning paths.

Effective and affordable control requires anticipating where transmission risks are likely to emerge so that interventions can be deployed proactively rather than reactively. This study introduces a novel framework that uncovers and exploits latent transmission links between urban regions, mined directly from publicly available dengue case data. Instead of treating cases as isolated reports, we model how hotspot formation in one area is influenced by epidemic dynamics in neighboring regions. While mosquito movement is highly localized, long-distance transmission is often driven by human mobility, and in our case study, the learned network aligns closely with commuting flows, providing an interpretable explanation for citywide spread. These hidden links are optimized through gradient descent and used not only to forecast hotspot status but also to verify the consistency of spreading patterns, by examining the stability of the inferred network across consecutive weeks. Case studies on Singapore during 2013-2018 and 2020 show that four weeks of hotspot history are sufficient to achieve an average F-score of 0.79. Importantly, the learned transmission links align with commuting flows, highlighting the interpretable interplay between hidden epidemic spread and human mobility. By shifting from simply reporting dengue cases to mining and validating hidden spreading dynamics, this work transforms open web-based case data into a predictive and explanatory resource. The proposed framework advances epidemic modeling while providing a scalable, low-cost tool for public health planning, early intervention, and urban resilience."}

During execution, the reward model system identifies erroneous actions, proposes refined alternatives, and continuously enhances agent behavior through an automated data-reflux mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicGUI-RMS yields substantial gains in task accuracy, behavioral robustness.

However, there are risks like hallucinations, toxicity, and stereotypes in their output that make them untrustworthy. We review various risks and vulnerabilities of modern general-purpose AI along eight widely accepted responsible AI (RAI) principles (fairness, privacy, explainability, robustness, safety, truthfulness, governance, and sustainability) and compare how they are non-existent or less severe and easily mitigable in traditional task-specific counterparts. We argue that this is due to the non-deterministically high Degree of Freedom in output (DoFo) of general-purpose AI (unlike the deterministically constant or low DoFo of traditional task-specific AI systems), and there is a need to rethink our approach to RAI for general-purpose AI. Following this, we derive C2V2 (Control, Consistency, Value, Veracity) desiderata to meet the RAI requirements for future general-purpose AI systems, and discuss how recent efforts in AI alignment, retrieval-augmented generation, reasoning enhancements, etc. fare along one or more of the desiderata. We believe that the goal of developing responsible general-purpose AI can be achieved by formally modeling application- or domain-dependent RAI requirements along C2V2 dimensions, and taking a system design approach to suitably combine various techniques to meet the desiderata."}

The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency.

Current LLM architectures and evaluation protocols rarely test for temporal awareness under real-time deadlines. We use simulated negotiations between paired agents under strict deadlines to investigate how LLMs adjust their behavior in time-sensitive settings. In a control condition, agents know only the global time limit. In a time-aware condition, they receive remaining-time updates at each turn. Deal closure rates are substantially higher (32\\% vs. 4\\% for GPT-5.1) and offer acceptances are sixfold higher in the time-aware condition than in the control, suggesting LLMs struggle to internally track elapsed time. However, the same LLMs achieve near-perfect deal closure rates ($\\geq$95\\%) under turn-based limits, revealing the failure is in temporal tracking rather than strategic reasoning.

Most existing design methods focus on vector-valued responses (e.g., Young's modulus and bandgap width), while the inverse design of functional responses remains challenging due to their high-dimensionality, the complexity of accommodating design requirements in inverse-design frameworks, and non-existence or non-uniqueness of feasible solutions. Although generative design approaches have shown promise, they are often data-hungry, handle design requirements heuristically, and may generate infeasible designs without uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce a RAndom-forest-based Generative approach (RAG). By leveraging the small-data compatibility of random forests, RAG enables data-efficient predictions of high-dimensional functional responses. During the inverse design, the framework estimates the likelihood through the ensemble which quantifies the trustworthiness of generated designs while reflecting the relative difficulty across different requirements. The one-to-many mapping is addressed through single-shot design generation by sampling from the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate RAG on: 1) acoustic metamaterials with prescribed partial passbands/stopbands, and 2) mechanical metamaterials with targeted snap-through responses, using 500 and 1057 samples, respectively.

To encourage the model to capture binding-relevant features rather than memorizing known sequences, we perform latent-space exploration and diffusion-based sampling, enabling the generation of peptides beyond the limited distribution of known binders. This zero-shot generative strategy leverages the global protein embedding manifold as a semantic prior, allowing the model to propose novel peptide sequences in previously unseen regions of the protein space.

This paper presents AgentForge, a lightweight, open-source Python framework designed to democratize the construction of LLM-driven autonomous agents through a principled modular architecture. AgentForge introduces three key innovations: (1) a composable skill abstraction that enables fine-grained task decomposition with formally defined input-output contracts, (2) a unified LLM backend interface supporting seamless switching between cloud-based APIs and local inference engines, and (3) a declarative YAML-based configuration system that separates agent logic from implementation details. We formalize the skill composition mechanism as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and prove its expressiveness for representing arbitrary sequential and parallel task workflows. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across four benchmark scenarios demonstrates that AgentForge achieves competitive task completion rates while reducing development time by 62% compared to LangChain and 78% compared to direct API integration. Latency measurements confirm sub-100ms orchestration overhead, rendering the framework suitable for real-time applications. The modular design facilitates extension: we demonstrate the integration of six built-in skills and provide comprehensive documentation for custom skill development. AgentForge addresses a critical gap in the LLM agent ecosystem by providing researchers and practitioners with a production-ready foundation for constructing, evaluating, and deploying autonomous agents without sacrificing flexibility or performance."}

This version corresponds to the initial public release of the CUA architecture and associated evaluation metrics", "summary": "The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new forms of AI-assisted reasoning across scientific, technical, and organizational domains. However, prevailing modes of LLM use remain cognitively unstructured: problem framing, knowledge exploration, retrieval, methodological awareness, and explanation are typically collapsed into a single generative process. This cognitive collapse limits traceability, weakens epistemic control, and undermines reproducibility, particularly in high-responsibility settings.\n  We introduce Explicit Cognitive Allocation, a general principle for structuring AI-assisted inference through the explicit separation and orchestration of epistemic functions. We instantiate this principle in the Cognitive Universal Agent (CUA), an architecture that organizes inference into distinct stages of exploration and framing, epistemic anchoring, instrumental and methodological mapping, and interpretive synthesis. Central to this framework is the notion of Universal Cognitive Instruments (UCIs), which formalize heterogeneous means, including computational, experimental, organizational, regulatory, and educational instruments, through which abstract inquiries become investigable.\n  We evaluate the effects of explicit cognitive and instrumental allocation through controlled comparisons between CUA-orchestrated inference and baseline LLM inference under matched execution conditions. Across multiple prompts in the agricultural domain, CUA inference exhibits earlier and structurally governed epistemic convergence, higher epistemic alignment under semantic expansion, and systematic exposure of the instrumental landscape of inquiry. In contrast, baseline LLM inference shows greater variability in alignment and fails to explicitly surface instrumental structure."}

We introduce SpatialBench-UC, a small, reproducible benchmark for pairwise spatial relations. The benchmark contains 200 prompts (50 object pairs times 4 relations) grouped into 100 counterfactual pairs obtained by swapping object roles. We release a benchmark package, versioned prompts, pinned configs, per-sample checker outputs, and report tables, enabling reproducible and auditable comparisons across models.

Focusing on the Travelling Salesman Problem, we show that encoding global structural constraints as an inductive bias enables a non-autoregressive model to generate solutions via direct forward passes, without search, supervision, or sequential decision-making. At inference time, dropout and snapshot ensembling allow a single model to act as an implicit ensemble, reducing optimality gaps through increased solution diversity. Our results establish that graph neural networks do not require supervised training nor explicit search to be effective. Instead, they can internalize global combinatorial structure and function as strong, learned heuristics. This reframes the role of learning in combinatorial optimization: from augmenting classical algorithms to directly instantiating new heuristics."}

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization ability in emotion analysis tasks, their diagnostic reliability in high-stakes, context-intensive medical settings remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Moreover, existing methods face two key challenges: emotional comorbidity, in which multiple intertwined emotional states complicate prediction, and inefficient exploration of clinically relevant cues. To address these challenges, we propose APOLO (Automated Prompt Optimization for Linguistic Emotion Diagnosis), a framework that systematically explores a broader and finer-grained prompt space to improve diagnostic efficiency and robustness. APOLO formulates instruction refinement as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and adopts a multi-agent collaboration mechanism involving Planner, Teacher, Critic, Student, and Target roles. Within this closed-loop framework, the Planner defines an optimization trajectory, while the Teacher-Critic-Student agents iteratively refine prompts to enhance reasoning stability and effectiveness, and the Target agent determines whether to continue optimization based on performance evaluation. Experimental results show that APOLO consistently improves diagnostic accuracy and robustness across domain-specific and stratified benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and generalizable paradigm for trustworthy LLM applications in mental healthcare."}

Rather than optimizing attacker policies within predefined structures, AgenticRed treats red-teaming as a system design problem. Inspired by methods like Meta Agent Search, we develop a novel procedure for evolving agentic systems using evolutionary selection, and apply it to the problem of automatic red-teaming. Red-teaming systems designed by AgenticRed consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 96% attack success rate (ASR) on Llama-2-7B (36% improvement) and 98% on Llama-3-8B on HarmBench. Our approach exhibits strong transferability to proprietary models, achieving 100% ASR on GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o-mini, and 60% on Claude-Sonnet-3.5 (24% improvement).

Given that language models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs by integrating reasoning capabilities, we draw on this approach to introduce a latent reasoning mechanism, and experimental validation demonstrates that this mechanism effectively reduces entropy in the model's decision-making process. Based on these findings, we introduce the Entropy-Guided Latent Reasoning (EGLR) recommendation model, which has three core advantages. First, it abandons the \"reason first, recommend later\" paradigm to achieve \"reasoning while recommending\", specifically designed for the high-difficulty nature of list generation by enabling real-time reasoning during generation. Second, it implements entropy-guided variable-length reasoning using context-aware reasoning token alongside dynamic temperature adjustment, expanding exploration breadth in reasoning and boosting exploitation precision in recommending to achieve a more precisely adapted exploration-exploitation trade-off. Third, the model adopts a lightweight integration design with no complex independent modules or post-processing, enabling easy adaptation to existing models. Experimental results on two real-world datasets validate the model's effectiveness, and its notable advantage lies in being compatible with existing generative re-ranking models to enhance their performance. Further analyses also demonstrate its practical deployment value and research potential."}

Modern AI systems, including LLMs and ViTs, largely operate as sequence-of-behavior prediction machines: they match observable behaviors by modeling token statistics without a persistent, readable mental state. This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state. We hypothesize that reasoning is a modality: reasoning should exist as a distinct channel separate from the low-level workspace on which rules are applied. To test this hypothesis, on solving ARC tasks as a visual reasoning problem, we designed a novel role-separated transformer block that splits global controller tokens from grid workspace tokens, enabling iterative rule execution. Trained and evaluated within the VARC vision-centric protocol, our method achieved 62.6% accuracy on ARC-1, surpassing average human performance (60.2%) and outperforming prior methods significantly.

We first construct a logistics topology graph by using the discrete GPS data using spatial clustering methods. Subsequently, a hybrid deep learning model combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to extract spatial correlations and temporal dependencies for predicting future congestion risks. These prediction results are then integrated into a dynamic edge weight mechanism to perform path planning. We evaluated the framework on the Smart Logistics Dataset 2024, which contains real-world Internet of Things(IoT) sensor data. The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain.

Results show that the Mafia Detector's mafia prediction accuracy is lower on LLM games than on human games. The result is consistent regardless of the game days and the number of mafias detected. This indicates that LLMs blend in better and thus deceive more effectively. We also release a dataset of LLM Mafia transcripts to support future research. Our findings underscore both the sophistication and risks of LLM deception in social contexts."}

Dissecting Probabilistic Confidence in Best-of-N Selection", "comment": "15 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "Probabilistic confidence metrics are increasingly adopted as proxies for reasoning quality in Best-of-N selection, under the assumption that higher confidence reflects higher reasoning fidelity. In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether these metrics truly capture inter-step causal dependencies necessary for valid reasoning. We introduce three classes of inter-step causality perturbations that systematically disrupt dependencies between reasoning steps while preserving local fluency. Surprisingly, across diverse model families and reasoning benchmarks, we find that selection accuracy degrades only marginally under these disruptions. Even severe interventions, such as applying hard attention masks that directly prevent the model from attending to prior reasoning steps, do not substantially reduce selection performance. These findings provide strong evidence that current probabilistic metrics are largely insensitive to logical structure, and primarily capture surface-level fluency or in-distribution priors instead. Motivated by this gap, we propose a contrastive causality metric that explicitly isolates inter-step causal dependencies, and demonstrate that it yields more faithful output selection than existing probability-based approaches."}

Current methods for shaping LRM behavior typically rely on reinforcement learning or fine-tuning with gold-standard reasoning traces, a paradigm that is both computationally expensive and difficult to scale. In this paper, we reveal that LRMs possess latent \\textit{reasoning beliefs} that internally track their own reasoning traits, which can be captured through simple logit probing. Building upon this insight, we propose Reasoning Belief Engineering (RELIEF), a simple yet effective framework that shapes LRM behavior by aligning the model's self-concept with a target belief blueprint. Crucially, RELIEF completely bypasses the need for reasoning-trace supervision. It internalizes desired traits by fine-tuning on synthesized, self-reflective question-answering pairs that affirm the target belief. Extensive experiments on efficiency and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that RELIEF matches or outperforms behavior-supervised and preference-based baselines while requiring lower training costs. Further analysis validates that shifting a model's reasoning belief effectively shapes its actual behavior."}

However, existing self-play frameworks often suffer from optimization instability, due to (i) non-stationary objectives induced by solver-dependent reward feedback for the Questioner, and (ii) bootstrapping errors from self-generated pseudo-labels used to supervise the Solver. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce DARC (Decoupled Asymmetric Reasoning Curriculum), a two-stage framework that stabilizes the self-evolution process. First, we train the Questioner to synthesize difficulty-calibrated questions, conditioned on explicit difficulty levels and external corpora. Second, we train the Solver with an asymmetric self-distillation mechanism, where a document-augmented teacher generates high-quality pseudo-labels to supervise the student Solver that lacks document access. Empirical results demonstrate that DARC is model-agnostic, yielding an average improvement of 10.9 points across nine reasoning benchmarks and three backbone models. Moreover, DARC consistently outperforms all baselines and approaches the performance of fully supervised models without relying on human annotations.The code is available at https://github.com/RUCBM/DARC."}

To distinguish genuine predictive capability from memorization-based performance, we analyze performance decay across temporally distinct market regimes, incorporating several quantitative baselines to establish performance thresholds. We evaluate prominent open-source LLMs -- Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) and DeepSeek 3.2 -- against a family of Point-in-Time LLMs (Pitinf-Small, Pitinf-Medium, and frontier-level model Pitinf-Large) from PiT-Inference. Results reveal significant lookahead bias in standard LLMs, as measured with alpha decay, unlike Pitinf models, which demonstrate improved generalization and reasoning abilities as they scale in size. This work establishes a foundation for the standardized evaluation of temporal bias in financial LLMs and provides a practical framework for identifying models suitable for real-world deployment.

Human-evaluation experiments (I) assessed perceptual legitimacy of replicas; (II) quantified area-level identity; (III) derived core identity-forming elements. Results showed a mean identification accuracy of ~81%, confirming the validity of the replicas.

However, their reliance on language material alone limits their ability to adapt, verify reasoning outcomes, and operate effectively in open and dynamic real-world environments. In this paper, we propose Human Simulation Computation (HSC), a human-inspired computational framework that models intelligence as a continuous, closed-loop process involving thinking, action, learning, reflection, and activity scheduling, collectively referred to as the internal reasoning process. HSC emphasizes active participation both within the internal reasoning process and in interactions with the environment, where actions are used not only to achieve goals but also to automatically refine and improve internal reasoning mechanisms without external intervention. Furthermore, HSC incorporates commonly used human thinking strategies across all stages of the internal reasoning process, such as main-feature-oriented reasoning, scope expansion through action, and on-time learning driven by environmental feedback. Through theoretical analysis, we argue that human simulation strategies cannot be fully learned from language material alone, and that human-like reasoning processes and action-grounded reasoning methods are essential for robust adaptation and effective interaction with real-world environments."}

Existing methods typically rely on full annotation, requiring users to continuously label affective states across entire sessions. While this process yields fine-grained data, it is time-consuming, cognitively demanding, and prone to fatigue and errors. To address these issues, we present PREFAB, a low-budget retrospective self-annotation method that targets affective inflection regions rather than full annotation. Grounded in the peak-end rule and ordinal representations of emotion, PREFAB employs a preference-learning model to detect relative affective changes, directing annotators to label only selected segments while interpolating the remainder of the stimulus. We further introduce a preview mechanism that provides brief contextual cues to assist annotation. We evaluate PREFAB through a technical performance study and a 25-participant user study. Results show that PREFAB outperforms baselines in modeling affective inflections while mitigating workload (and conditionally mitigating temporal burden). Importantly PREFAB improves annotator confidence without degrading annotation quality."}

Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate."}

However, existing approaches often rely on task-specific pipelines and trained formal provers, limiting their flexibility and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the paradigm that directly uses a general coding agent as a formal math reasoner. This paradigm is motivated by (1) A general coding agent provides a natural interface for diverse reasoning tasks beyond proving, (2) Performance can be improved by simply replacing the underlying base model, without training, and (3) MCP enables flexible extension and autonomous calling of specialized tools, avoiding complex design. Based on this paradigm, we introduce Numina-Lean-Agent, which combines Claude Code with Numina-Lean-MCP to enable autonomous interaction with Lean, retrieval of relevant theorems, informal proving and auxiliary reasoning tools. Using Claude Opus 4.5 as the base model, Numina-Lean-Agent solves all problems in Putnam 2025 (12 / 12), matching the best closed-source system. Beyond benchmark evaluation, we further demonstrate its generality by interacting with mathematicians to successfully formalize the Brascamp-Lieb theorem.

From subcellular chemical networks to swarms of organisms, and across evolved, engineered, and chimeric systems, it is hypothesized that scale-invariant principles of decision-making can be discovered. We propose that cognition in both natural and synthetic systems can be characterized and understood by the interplay between two equally important invariants: (1) the remapping of embedding spaces, and (2) the navigation within these spaces. Biological collectives, from single cells to entire organisms (and beyond), remap transcriptional, morphological, physiological, or 3D spaces to maintain homeostasis and regenerate structure, while navigating these spaces through distributed error correction. Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, including transformers, diffusion models, and neural cellular automata enact analogous processes by remapping data into latent embeddings and refining them iteratively through contextualization. We argue that this dual principle - remapping and navigation of embedding spaces via iterative error minimization - constitutes a substrate-independent invariant of cognition. Recognizing this shared mechanism not only illuminates deep parallels between living systems and artificial models, but also provides a unifying framework for engineering adaptive intelligence across scales."}

Our system decomposes complex feedback into atomic concerns and dynamically constructs hybrid contexts by synthesizing compressed summaries with high-fidelity text while integrating an autonomous and on-demand external search module to resolve concerns requiring outside literature. By generating an inspectable response plan before drafting, $\\textbf{RebuttalAgent}$ ensures that every argument is explicitly anchored in internal or external evidence.

While the effectiveness of agents has continued to improve, efficiency, which is crucial for real-world deployment, has often been overlooked. This paper therefore investigates efficiency from three core components of agents: memory, tool learning, and planning, considering costs such as latency, tokens, steps, etc. Aimed at conducting comprehensive research addressing the efficiency of the agentic system itself, we review a broad range of recent approaches that differ in implementation yet frequently converge on shared high-level principles including but not limited to bounding context via compression and management, designing reinforcement learning rewards to minimize tool invocation, and employing controlled search mechanisms to enhance efficiency, which we discuss in detail. Accordingly, we characterize efficiency in two complementary ways: comparing effectiveness under a fixed cost budget, and comparing cost at a comparable level of effectiveness. This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. From this perspective, we also examine efficiency oriented benchmarks by summarizing evaluation protocols for these components and consolidating commonly reported efficiency metrics from both benchmark and methodological studies. Moreover, we discuss the key challenges and future directions, with the goal of providing promising insights."}

This work aims at providing an overview of communication techniques in multi-agent reinforcement learning. By an in-depth analysis of 29 publications on this topic, the strengths and weaknesses of explicit, implicit, attention-based, graph-based, and hierarchical/role-based communication are evaluated. The results of this comparison show that there is no general, optimal communication framework for every problem. On the contrary, the choice of communication depends heavily on the problem at hand. The comparison also highlights the importance of communication methods with low computational overhead to enable scalability to environments where many agents interact.

Another primary contribution of this work is the in-depth technical delineation of two complementary communication protocols - the Model Context Protocol, which standardizes how agents access external tools and contextual data, and the Agent2Agent protocol, which governs peer coordination, negotiation, and delegation. Together, these protocols establish an interoperable communication substrate that enables scalable, auditable, and policy-compliant reasoning across distributed agent collectives.
