As an important tool for studying\ncomplex systems, computational experiments can map them into artificial society\nmodels that are computable and reproducible within computers, thereby providing\ndigital and computational methods for quantitative analysis. In current\nresearch, the construction of individual agent models often ignores the\nlong-term accumulative effect of memory mechanisms in the development process\nof agents, which to some extent causes the constructed models to deviate from\nthe real characteristics of real-world systems. To address this challenge, this\npaper proposes an individual agent model based on a memory-learning\ncollaboration mechanism, which implements hierarchical modeling of the memory\nmechanism and a multi-indicator evaluation mechanism. Through hierarchical\nmodeling of the individual memory repository, the group memory repository, and\nthe memory buffer pool, memory can be effectively managed, and knowledge\nsharing and dissemination between individuals and groups can be promoted. At\nthe same time, the multi-indicator evaluation mechanism enables dynamic\nevaluation of memory information, allowing dynamic updates of information in\nthe memory set and promoting collaborative decision-making between memory and\nlearning. Experimental results show that, compared with existing memory\nmodeling methods, the agents constructed by the proposed model demonstrate\nbetter decision-making quality and adaptability within the system. This\nverifies the effectiveness of the individual agent model based on the\nmemory-learning collaboration mechanism proposed in this paper in improving the\nquality of individual-level modeling in artificial society modeling and\nachieving anthropomorphic characteristics."}

Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models\n(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign\nrisk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a\ntraining dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134\npatients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct\nfeatures. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated\nCoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline\nbased on the 2017 ACR White Paper.

Our\nmethodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of\nvarying complexity ($5\\times 5$ to $15\\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate\nfeedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test\nfundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across\nidentical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic\ntransfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while\nOpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\\times 30$,\nother models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\\times 9$ mazes, with 100%\nof failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a\ncell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in\nIcelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English,\nsuggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather\nthan language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications\nfor global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial\nintelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability\nand highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable\nnavigation across linguistic contexts."}

However, challenges are still open for interactive systems to\neffectively guide users through the configuration process. The aim of our work\nis to provide an ASP-based solver for interactive configuration that can deal\nwith large-scale industrial configuration problems and that supports intuitive\nuser interfaces via an API. In this paper, we focus on improving the\nperformance of automatically completing a partial configuration. Our main\ncontribution enhances the classical incremental approach for multi-shot solving\nby four different smart expansion functions. The core idea is to determine and\nadd specific objects or associations to the partial configuration by exploiting\ncautious and brave consequences before checking for the existence of a complete\nconfiguration with the current objects in each iteration. This approach limits\nthe number of costly unsatisfiability checks and reduces the search space,\nthereby improving solving performance. In addition, we present a user interface\nthat uses our API and is implemented in ASP."}

Current automation approaches are often limited by either\ninflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous\nagents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry.\nGenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists\nthat integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability\nof autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through\ntyped message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a\nshared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning\nframework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action\nUnits and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack,\nthereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the\nidiosyncrasies of genomic data.\n  On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation\nof 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene\nidentification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85%\nrespectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible\ngene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting\nfor latent confounders.

As LLMs are\nincreasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static\nnature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can\nadaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from\nscaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing\ninterest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and\nadaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the\nfirst systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized\naround three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how\nto evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,\nmodels, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages\n(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and\narchitectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,\ntextual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we\nanalyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,\nhighlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,\nand identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,\nscalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework\nfor understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a\nroadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world\ndeployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of\nArtificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,\nperforming at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks."}
