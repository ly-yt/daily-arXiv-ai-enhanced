Integrating System Dynamics (SD) and Agent Based Modelling (ABM)\nallows the proposed multi level framework to capture uncertainties in work\neffort, team size, and project duration, which influence technological\nprogress. While AB SD hybrid models are established in other fields, their use\nin R and D remains limited. The model combines system level feedback structures\ngoverning work phases, rework cycles, and duration with decentralised agents\nsuch as team members, tasks, and controllers, whose interactions generate\nemergent project dynamics. A base case scenario analysed early stage innovation\nprojects with 15 parallel tasks over 156 weeks. A comparative sequential\nscenario showed an 88 percent reduction in rework duration. A second scenario\nassessed mixed parallel sequential task structures with varying team sizes. In\nparallel configurations, increasing team size reduced project duration and\nimproved task completion, with optimal results for teams of four to five\nmembers. These findings align with empirical evidence showing that moderate\nteam expansion enhances coordination efficiency without excessive communication\noverhead.

We introduce CE-Graph, a\nframework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven\nrefinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool\nof counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,\nand applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify\nmechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA\nbenchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower\ncost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges\nnot from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the\ngeometric structure of its failure distributions."}

Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that\nmixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,\nstable solution.

To address this, we\nintroduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware\nsampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER).

If the risk level\ncannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated\nsampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ\ncalibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated\nbudget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically\nvalid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the\ncandidate set for each test data point.

Identifying which\nreasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably\npredicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and\nimprove overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that\ncharacterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations\nduring the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the\noverall change in latent representations between the start and end of\nreasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to\nwhich these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals\npredict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and\noutput-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across\nmultiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling\nmore effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up\nto 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.\nMoreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,\nenabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising\ncandidates.

To support\nstandardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent\nexecution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and\nprogrammatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most\nadvanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%\naverage accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,\nhighlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical\nfindings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,\noften invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the\ncommunity to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for\nscientific discovery. Our code and data are available\nhttps://github.com/Melmaphother/PaperArena."}

This results in (i) mode collapse into\nrepetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where\nanswers are only weakly supported by cited content.\n  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL\nframework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,\nreasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified\nstep-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based\nsensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that\ntool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.\n  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and\nout-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong\nDeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and\ntool-routing balance.

As requirements grow, these\ndocuments expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates\ndeveloping internalization methods that embed policy documents into model\npriors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets\ngeneric prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels\nand require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce\nCC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four\nlevels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity\nand offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our\nanalysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose\nmajor reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent\ninteraction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy\ncomplexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose\nCategory-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline\nparses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into\nfactual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex\nconditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis\nand enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive\npretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all\nsettings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt\nlength reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT\ndata."}
