Our method has two main components: a dialogue system\nand language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs\nconditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to\ncontrol the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial\nand social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation\nand each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to\ncontrol the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables\nagents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the\nongoing dialogue.\n  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay\nbetween social interactions, steering, and crowding.

It\nfeatures programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables,\ncreated with Python visualization libraries to ensure control over data\nsemantics, structure, and clarity. Each GRAFT instance pairs a chart or table\nimage with a systematically generated, multi-step analytical question based\nsolely on visual content. Answers are provided in structured formats such as\nJSON or YAML, supporting consistent evaluation of both reasoning and output\nformat. The benchmark introduces a taxonomy of reasoning types including\ncomparison, trend identification, ranking, aggregation, proportion estimation,\nand anomaly detection to enable comprehensive assessment. Reference answers\nfollow strict factual and formatting guidelines for precise, aspect-based\nevaluation. GRAFT offers a unified, scalable framework for fine-grained\nbenchmarking of multimodal models on visually grounded, structured reasoning\ntasks, setting a new evaluation standard in this field."}

As such, NiceWebRL enables AI researchers to compare\ntheir algorithms to human performance, cognitive scientists to test ML\nalgorithms as theories for human cognition, and multi-agent researchers to\ndevelop algorithms for human-AI collaboration. We showcase NiceWebRL with 3\ncase studies that demonstrate its potential to help develop Human-like AI,\nHuman-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study\n(Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of\ncognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human\nparticipants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our\nsecond case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a\nnovel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the\nOvercooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we\nshow how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans\non complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of\nhierarchical tasks.

However, no studies have measured AI serving\nenvironmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this\ngap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the\nenergy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads\nin a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full\nstack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,\nhost system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.\nThrough detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the\nGemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24\nWh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also\nshow that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement\nhave driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon\nfootprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify\nthat the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine\nseconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of\nwater (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily\nactivities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to\nwarrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a\ncomprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for\naccurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains\nacross the full AI serving stack."}

Yet preventing such dynamics\nis challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private\nconversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently\nharmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation\nframework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that\nevaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the\nfeasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of\nthirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.\nIterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all\nparasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant\nunanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few\nexchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents\ncan provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations."}

Traditional approaches treat these\ndimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated\nmethods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about\noptimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel\nframework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently\noptimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual\ngradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization\nby providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration\ninterdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that\nproposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an\nOptimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving\nfeedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT\ndemonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,\nachieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability."}
